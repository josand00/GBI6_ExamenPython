TI  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants reduce COVID-19infection: prospects for use.
LID - 10.1007/s00228-022-03372-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The absence of specific treatments for COVID-19 leads to an intenseglobal effort in the search for new therapeutic interventions and better clinicaloutcomes for patients. This review aimed to present a selection of acceptedstudies that reported the activity of antidepressant drugs belonging to theselective serotonin receptor inhibitor (SSRI) class for treating the novelcoronavirus. METHODS: A search was performed in PubMed and SciELO databases usingthe following search strategies: [(coronavirus) OR (COVID) OR (SARS-CoV-2) AND(antidepressant) OR (serotonin) OR (selective serotonin receptor inhibitors)]. Inthe end, eleven articles were included. We also covered information obtained fromClinicalTrials.gov in our research. RESULTS: Although several clinical trials areongoing, only a few drugs have been officially approved to treat the infection.Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, despite favorable preliminary results, hasrestricted the use due to the risk of toxicity and methodological flaws.Antidepressant drugs were able to reduce the risk of intubation or death related to COVID-19, decrease the need for intensive medical care, and severely inhibitviral titers by up to 99%. Among the SSRIs studied so far, fluoxetine andfluvoxamine have shown to be the most promising against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION:If successful, these drugs can substantially reduce hospitalization and mortalityrates, as well as allow for fully outpatient treatment for mild-to-moderateinfections. Thus, repositioning SSRIs can provide benefits when faced with arapidly evolving pandemic such as COVID-19.

TI  - DRPADC: A novel drug repositioning algorithm predicting adaptive drugs forCOVID-19.
PG  - 107947
LID - 10.1016/j.compchemeng.2022.107947 [doi]
AB  - Given that the usual process of developing a new vaccine or drug for COVID-19demands significant time and funds, drug repositioning has emerged as a promisingtherapeutic strategy. We propose a method named DRPADC to predict noveldrug-disease associations effectively from the original sparse drug-diseaseassociation adjacency matrix. Specifically, DRPADC processes the originalassociation matrix with the WKNKN algorithm to reduce its sparsity. Furthermore, multiple types of similarity information are fused by a CKA-MKL algorithm.Finally, a compressed sensing algorithm is used to predict the potentialdrug-disease (virus) association scores. Experimental results show that DRPADChas superior performance than several competitive methods in terms of AUC values and case studies. DRPADC achieved the AUC value of 0.941, 0.955 and 0.876 inFdataset, Cdataset and HDVD dataset, respectively. In addition, the conductedcase studies of COVID-19 show that DRPADC can predict drug candidates accurately.

AB  - The unprecedented outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)Coronavirus-2, across the globe, triggered a worldwide uproar in the search forimmediate treatment strategies. With no specific drug and not much dataavailable, alternative approaches such as drug repurposing came to the limelight.To date, extensive research on the repositioning of drugs has led to theidentification of numerous drugs against various important protein targets of thecoronavirus strains, with hopes of the drugs working against the major variantsof concerns (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, omicron) of the virus. Advancements incomputational sciences have led to improved scope of repurposing via techniquessuch as structure-based approaches including molecular docking, molecular dynamicsimulations and quantitative structure activity relationships, network-basedapproaches, and artificial intelligence-based approaches with other core machine and deep learning algorithms. This review highlights the various approaches torepurposing drugs from a computational biological perspective, with variousmechanisms of action of the drugs against some of the major protein targets ofSARS-CoV-2. Additionally, clinical trials data on potential COVID-19 repurposeddrugs are also highlighted with stress on the major SARS-CoV-2 targets and thestructural effect of variants on these targets. The interaction modelling of someimportant repurposed drugs has also been elucidated. Furthermore, the merits and demerits of drug repurposing are also discussed, with a focus on the scope andapplications of the latest advancements in repurposing.

AB  - According to recent reports out of India, a new strain of Severe AcuteRespiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) B1.1.529 Omicron virus hasemerged. In comparison to the Wuhan (WHU) strain and the delta variant, thisvariant showed a far stronger effect on the angiotensin converting enzyme2 (ACE2)receptor. There are several medicinal compounds in plant metabolites, and theirdiverse chemical structures make them ideal for the treatment of seriousillnesses. It's possible that some of these could be useful alternativepharmaceuticals, as well as a starting point for the repurposing of existingmedications and new chemical discoveries. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered aworldwide epidemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). There havebeen trials for different therapies for SARS-CoV-2 and so also there are recentannouncements of extensive research into the development of viable medicines for this global health calamity. After a thorough examination of plant-derivedtreatments for COVID-19, investigators in the current study decided to focus onplant-derived secondary metabolites (PSMs). According to some researchers, newMDR (Multi-Drug Resistant) antibiotics may one day be developed due to theadaptability of secondary metabolites. Identifying plant metabolites that cantreat a wide range of viral infections was one of the study's aims. Many natural medications that could be recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 werediscovered as a result of this research, including remedies from plant families, viral candidates that are susceptible, antiviral assays, and mechanisms oftherapeutic action. The findings of this study will inspire further research and speed up the development of new antiviral plant-based medications.

AB  - Sublineages of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2)Omicron variants continue to amass mutations in the spike (S) glycoprotein, whichleads to immune evasion and rapid spread of the virus across the humanpopulation. Here we demonstrate the susceptibility of the Omicron variant BA.1(B.1.1.529.1) to four repurposable drugs, Methylene blue (MB), Mycophenolic acid (MPA), Posaconazole (POS), and Niclosamide (Niclo) in post-exposure treatments ofprimary human airway cell cultures. MB, MPA, POS, and Niclo are known to blockinfection of human nasal and bronchial airway epithelial explant cultures (HAEEC)with the Wuhan strain, and four variants of concern (VoC), Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (B.1.1.28), Delta (B.1.617.2) (Weiss et al., 2021, Murer et al.,2022). Our results here not only reinforce the broad anti-coronavirus effects of MB, MPA, POS and Niclo, but also demonstrate that the Omicron variant BA.1(B.1.1.529.1) sheds infectious virus from HAEEC over at least 15 d, and maintainsboth intracellular and extracellular viral genomic RNA without overt toxicity,suggesting viral persistence. The data emphasize the potential of repurposabledrugs against COVID-19.

AB  - This study proposes a novel model for integration of SARS-CoV-2 into host cellvia endocytosis as a possible alternative to the prevailing direct fusion model. It is known that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage atS1-S2 cleavage site and the cleaved S2 domain is primed by the activated serineprotease domain (SPD) of humanTMPRSS2 to become S2'. The activated SPD of TMPRSS2is formed after it is cleaved by autocatalysis from the membrane boundnon-catalytic ectodomain (hNECD) comprising of LDLRA CLASS-I repeat and a SRCRdomain. It is known that the SRCR domains as well as LDLRA repeat harboringproteins mediate endocytosis of viruses and certain ligands. Based on this, weput forward a hypothesis that the exposed hNECD binds to the S2' as both are atan interaction proximity soon after S2 is processed by the SPD and thisinteraction may lead to the endocytosis of virus. Based on this hypothesis wehave modelled the hNECD structure, followed by docking studies with the known 3D structure of S2'. The interaction interface of hNECD with S2' was further usedfor virtual screening of FDA-approved drug molecules and Indian medicinalplant-based compounds. We also mapped the known mutations of concern andmutations of interest on interaction interface of S2' and found that none of the known mutations map onto the interaction interface. This indicates that targetingthe interaction between the hNECD of TMPRSS2 and S2' may serve as an attractivetherapeutic target.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently the most serious publichealth threat faced by mankind. Thus, the severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, is being intensivelyinvestigated. Several vaccines are now available for clinical use. However, owingto the highly mutated nature of RNA viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 is changing at arapid speed. Breakthrough infections by SARS-CoV-2 variants have been seen invaccinated individuals. As a result, effective therapeutics for treating COVID-19patients is urgently required. With the advance of computer technology,computational methods have become increasingly powerful in the biomedicalresearch and pharmaceutical drug discovery. The applications of these techniques have largely reduced the costs and simplified processes of pharmaceutical drugdevelopments. Intensive and extensive studies on SARS-CoV-2 proteins have beencarried out and three-dimensional structures of the major SARS-CoV-2 proteinshave been resolved and deposited in the Protein Data Bank. These structuresprovide the foundations for drug discovery and design using the structure-basedcomputations, such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Inthis review, introduction to the applications of computational methods in thediscovery and design of novel drugs and repurposing of existing drugs for thetreatments of COVID-19 is given. The examples of computer-aided investigationsand screening of COVID-19 effective therapeutic compounds, functional peptides,as well as effective molecules from the herb medicines are discussed.

AB  - The novel coronavirus that has affected the whole world is declared a pandemic bythe World Health Organization. Since the emergence of this virus, researchersworldwide have searched for potential antivirals against it. Being an RNA virus, it shows a high rate of mutability and variability in its genome. In the present study, all the reported SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from diverse regions of theworld available in the GISAID database have been considered for phylogeneticanalysis. The strain identified at the root is subjected to phylogenetic analysiswith genomes of other known human viruses obtained from NCBI for identifying the nearest viral neighbor. Furthermore, the phylogenetic relationship betweenvarious human viruses was used to repurpose the known antiviral drugs towardscoronavirus using in silico docking approach. The phylogeny reveals the link ofthe COVID virus with adenovirus. The known drugs against adenovirus areconsidered in the present study for drug repurposing through molecular dockinganalysis. The reference inhibitors of the respective targets were also consideredin the docking study. The protein targets, namely protease, endoribonuclease,methyltransferase, phosphatase, and spike protein, are considered for screeningwith the known drug of adenovirus. Ribavirin, known to treat adenoviralinfection, shows the best docking score, suggesting its use as a repurposed drug to treat SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the potency of the ribavirin drug is analyzedusing molecular dynamics studies.

AB  - Currently, various potential therapeutic agents for coronavirus disease-2019(COVID-19), a global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are being investigated worldwide mainly through thedrug repurposing approach. Several anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-malarial, andanti-inflammatory drugs were employed in randomized trials and observationalstudies for developing new therapeutics for COVID-19. Although an increasingnumber of repurposed drugs have shown anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities in vitro, so faronly remdesivir has been approved by the US FDA to treat COVID-19, and severalother drugs approved for Emergency Use Authorization, including sotrovimab,tocilizumab, baricitinib, paxlovid, molnupiravir, and other potential strategies to develop safe and effective therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infection are stillunderway. Many drugs employed as anti-viral may exert unwanted side effects(i.e., toxicity) via unknown mechanisms. To quickly assess these drugs for their potential toxicological effects and mechanisms, we used the Tox21 in vitro assay datasets generated from screening approximately 10,000 compounds consisting ofapproved drugs and environmental chemicals against multiple cellular targets and pathways. Here we summarize the toxicological profiles of small molecule drugsthat are currently under clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 based ontheir in vitro activities against various targets and cellular signalingpathways.

TI  - Repurposing Metformin for Vascular Disease.
LID - 10.2174/0929867329666220729154615 [doi]
AB  - Metformin has seen use as an oral anti-hyperglycaemic drug since the late 1950s; however, following the release in 1998 of the findings of the 20-year UnitedKingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) metformin use rapidly increased andtoday is the first-choice anti-hyperglycaemic drug for patients with type 2diabetes (T2D). Metformin is in daily use by an estimated 150 million peopleworldwide. Historically, the benefits of metformin as an anti-diabetic andcardiovascular-protective drug have been linked to effects in the liver, where itacts to inhibit gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis, as well as reducing insulinresistance and enhancing peripheral glucose utilization. However, directprotective effects on the endothelium and effects in the gut prior to metforminabsorption are now recognized as being important. In the gut, metformin modulatesthe glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)- gut-brain axis as well as impacting theintestinal microbiota. As the apparent number of putative tissue and cellulartargets for metformin has increased, so has interest in re-purposing metformin totreat other diseases that include polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), cancer,neurodegenerative diseases and COVID-19. Metformin is also being investigated as an anti-ageing drug. Of particular interest is whether metformin provides thesame level of vascular protection in individuals other than those with T2D,including obese individuals with metabolic syndrome, or in the setting ofvascular thromboinflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2. In this review we criticallyevaluate the literature to highlight clinical settings in which metformin mightbe therapeutically repurposed for the prevention and treatment of vasculardisease.

AB  - COVID-19, a dreaded and highly contagious pandemic, is flagrantly known for itsrapid prevalence across the world. Till date, none of the treatments aredistinctly accessible for this life-threatening disease. Under the prevailingconditions of medical emergency, one creative strategy for the identification of novel and potential antiviral agents gaining momentum in research institutionsand progressively being leveraged by pharmaceutical companies is target-baseddrug repositioning/repurposing. A continuous monitoring and recording of results offer an anticipation that this strategy may help to reveal new medications forviral infections. This review recapitulates the neoteric illation of COVID-19,its genomic dispensation, molecular evolution via phylogenetic assessment, drugtargets, the most frequently worldwide used repurposed drugs and theirtherapeutic applications, and a recent update on vaccine management strategies.The available data from solidarity trials exposed that the treatment with severalknown drugs, viz. lopinavir-ritonavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, etc haddisplayed various antagonistic effects along with no impactful result indiminution of mortality rate. The drugs like remdesivir, favipiravir, andribavirin proved to be quite safer therapeutic options for treatment againstCOVID-19. Similarly, dexamethasone, convalescent plasma therapy and oraladministration of 2DG are expected to reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19patients.

AB  - The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has had unprecedented social and economic ramifications. Identifyingtargets for drug repurposing could be an effective means to present new and fast treatments. Furthermore, the risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 goesup when there are coexisting medical conditions, however, the underlyingmechanisms remain unclear. In the current study, we have adopted a network-based systems biology approach to investigate the RNA binding proteins (RBPs)-basedmolecular interplay between COVID-19, various human cancers, and neurologicaldisorders. The network based on RBPs commonly involved in the three diseaseconditions consisted of nine RBPs connecting 10 different cancer types, 22 brain disorders, and COVID-19 infection, ultimately hinting at the comorbidities andcomplexity of COVID-19. Further, we underscored five miRNAs with reportedantiviral properties that target all of the nine shared RBPs and are thustherapeutically valuable. As a strategy to improve the clinical conditions incomorbidities associated with COVID-19, we propose perturbing the shared RBPs by drug repurposing. The network-based analysis presented hereby contributes to abetter knowledge of the molecular underpinnings of the comorbidities associatedwith COVID-19.

TI  - Drug repurposing: a systematic review on root causes, barriers and facilitators.
PG  - 970
LID - 10.1186/s12913-022-08272-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Repurposing is a drug development strategy receiving heightenedattention after the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency useauthorization of several repurposed drugs to treat Covid-19. There remainknowledge gaps on the root causes, facilitators and barriers for repurposing.METHOD: This systematic review used controlled vocabulary and free text terms to search ABI/Informa, Academic Search Premier, Business Source Complete, CochraneLibrary, EconLit, Google Scholar, Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection databases for the characteristics, reasons andexample of companies deprioritizing development of promising drugs and barriers, facilitators and examples of successful re-purposing. RESULTS: We identified11,814 articles, screened 5,976 for relevance, found 437 eligible for full textreview, 115 of which were included in full analysis. Most articles (66%, 76/115) discussed why promising drugs are abandoned, with lack of efficacy or superiorityto other therapies (n = 59), strategic business reasons (n = 35), safety problems(n = 28), research design decisions (n = 12), the complex nature of a studieddisease or drug (n = 7) and regulatory bodies requiring more information (n = 2) among top reasons. Key barriers to repurposing include inadequate resources (n = 42), trial data access and transparency around abandoned compounds (n = 20) andexpertise (n = 11). Additional barriers include uncertainty about the value ofrepurposing (n = 13), liability risks (n = 5) and intellectual property (IP)challenges (n = 26). Facilitators include the ability to form multi-partnercollaborations (n = 38), access to compound databases and database screeningtools (n = 32), regulatory modifications (n = 5) and tax incentives (n = 2).CONCLUSION: Promising drugs are commonly shelved due to insufficient efficacy or superiority to alternate therapies, poor market prospects, and industryconsolidation. Inadequate resources and data access and challenges negotiating IPare key barriers to repurposing reaching its full potential as a core approach indrug development. Multi-partner collaborations and the availability and use ofcompound databases and tax incentives are key facilitators for repurposing. More research is needed on the current value of repurposing in drug development andhow to better facilitate resources to support it, where valuable, especiallyfinancial, staffing for out-licensing shelved products, and legal expertise tonegotiate IP agreements in multi-partner collaborations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The protocol was registered on Open Science Framework ( https://osf.io/f634k/ ) as itwas not eligible for registration on PROSPERO as the review did not focus on ahealth-related outcome.

AB  - During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, symptoms ofdepression are commonly documented among both symptomatic and asymptomaticquarantined COVID-19 patients. Despite that many of the FDA-approved drugs havebeen showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro and remarkable efficacy againstCOVID-19 in clinical trials, no pharmaceutical products have yet been declared tobe fully effective for treating COVID-19. Antidepressants comprise five majordrug classes for the treatment of depression, neuralgia, migraine prophylaxis,and eating disorders which are frequently reported symptoms in COVID-19 patients.Herein, the efficacy of eight frequently prescribed FDA-approved antidepressants on the inhibition of both SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV was assessed. Additionally, thein vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-MERS-CoV activities were evaluated.Furthermore, molecular docking studies have been performed for these drugsagainst the spike (S) and main protease (M(pro)) pockets of both SARS-CoV-2 andMERS-CoV. Results showed that Amitriptyline, Imipramine, Paroxetine, andSertraline had potential anti-viral activities. Our findings suggested that theaforementioned drugs deserve more in vitro and in vivo studies targeting COVID-19especially for those patients suffering from depression.

TI  - Are the Current Processes and Regulations Fit for Purpose to Deliver NovelTherapies During Pandemics? A Perspective on COVID-19 from the UK.
LID - 10.1007/s40290-022-00439-7 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic was the first 'stress test' to assess whether the currentregulations in the United Kingdom (UK) are fit for purpose to develop noveltherapies during pandemics. It saw innovations and collaborations across thespectrum of the drug development and regulatory pathways, including extraordinarycollaborations between the various stakeholders involved in the process, therepositioning of medicines, the deployment of multi-arm, multi-interventionaladaptive trials, the institution of operational simplicity and flexibility acrossvarious trial activities, and regulatory innovations. The question arises whetherthe innovative flexibilities and the urgency that were instituted could haveresulted in compromises to the integrity of the process. An assessment of theconduct of the RECOVERY trial and the speedy approval of dexamethasone by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency demonstrates that nocompromises were made to the ethical and scientific integrity of the process.Lessons learnt could be applied for future pandemics and to enhance R&Dproductivity and contribute to global health by improving access to medicines,especially in low- and middle-income countries and for neglected or rarediseases. What is needed is not a major transformation in the process but theflexible adaptation of existing regulations to reduce bureaucracy and handovertimes. Arriving at an optimal balance between scientific standards, regulationsand commercial conflicts of interest will pose considerable challenges but whatthe COVID-19 pandemic has shown is that where there is will, there is always away.

LID - 10.3390/molecules27144327 [doi]
AB  - Different pathological conditions, including viral infections and cancer, canhave a massive impact on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), causing severe damage tothe cell and exacerbating the disease. In particular, coronavirus infections,including SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for COVID-19, cause ERstress as a consequence of the enormous amounts of viral glycoproteinssynthesized, the perturbation of ER homeostasis and the modification of ERmembranes. Therefore, ER has a central role in the viral life cycle, thusrepresenting one of the Achilles' heels on which to focus therapeuticintervention. On the other hand, prolonged ER stress has been demonstrated topromote many pro-tumoral attributes in cancer cells, having a key role in tumorgrowth, metastasis and response to therapies. In this report, adopting arepurposing approach of approved drugs, we identified the antiplatelet agentticlopidine as an interferent of the unfolded protein response (UPR) via sigmareceptors (SRs) modulation. The promising results obtained suggest the potential use of ticlopidine to counteract ER stress induced by viral infections, such asCOVID-19, and cancer.

AB  - More than two years have passed since the viral outbreak that led to the novelinfectious respiratory disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.Since then, the urgency for effective treatments resulted in unprecedentedefforts to develop new vaccines and to accelerate the drug discovery pipeline,mainly through the repurposing of well-known compounds with broad antiviraleffects. In particular, antiparasitic drugs historically used against humaninfections due to protozoa or helminth parasites have entered the main stage as amiracle cure in the fight against SARS-CoV-2. Despite having demonstratedpromising anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities in vitro, conflicting results have madetheir translation into clinical practice more difficult than expected. Since manystudies involving antiparasitic drugs are currently under investigation, thewindow of opportunity might be not closed yet. Here, we will review the(controversial) journey of these old antiparasitic drugs to combat the humaninfection caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic causes many morbidity andmortality cases. Despite several developed vaccines and antiviral therapies, somepatients experience severe conditions that need intensive care units (ICU);therefore, precision medicine is necessary to predict and treat these patientsusing novel biomarkers and targeted drugs. In this study, we proposed amulti-level biological network analysis framework to identify key genes viaprotein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis as well as survival analysisbased on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in leukocyte transcriptomicprofiles, discover novel biomarkers using microRNAs (miRNA) from regulatorynetwork analysis, and provide candidate drugs targeting the key genes usingdrug-gene interaction network and structural analysis. The results show thatupregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in cell division, cell cycle, and innateimmune signaling pathways. Downregulated DEGs were primarily concentrated in the cellular response to stress, lysosome, glycosaminoglycan catabolic process, andmature B cell differentiation. Regulatory network analysis revealed thathsa-miR-6792-5p, hsa-let-7b-5p, hsa-miR-34a-5p, hsa-miR-92a-3p, andhsa-miR-146a-5p were predicted biomarkers. CDC25A, GUSB, MYBL2, and SDAD1 wereidentified as key genes in severe COVID-19. In addition, drug repurposing fromdrug-gene and drug-protein database searching and molecular docking showed thatcamptothecin and doxorubicin were candidate drugs interacting with the key genes.In conclusion, multi-level systems biology analysis plays an important role inprecision medicine by finding novel biomarkers and targeted drugs based on keygene identification.

AB  - Repurposing of existing drugs is a rapid way to find potential new treatments forSARS-CoV-2. Here, we applied a virtual screening approach using Autodock Vina andmolecular dynamic simulation in tandem to screen and calculate binding energiesof repurposed drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 helicase protein (non-structuralprotein nsp13). Amongst the top hits from our study were antivirals,antihistamines, and antipsychotics, plus a range of other drugs. Approximately30% of our top 87 hits had published evidence indicating in vivo or in vitroSARS-CoV-2 activity. Top hits not previously reported to have SARS-CoV-2 activityincluded the antiviral agents, cabotegravir and RSV-604; the NK1 antagonist,aprepitant; the trypanocidal drug, aminoquinuride; the analgesic, antrafenine;the anticancer intercalator, epirubicin; the antihistamine, fexofenadine; and theanticoagulant, dicoumarol. These hits from our in silico SARS-CoV-2 helicasescreen warrant further testing as potential COVID-19 treatments.

LID - 10.3390/genes13071210 [doi]
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a dramatic loss ofhuman life and devastated the worldwide economy. Numerous efforts have been made to mitigate COVID-19 symptoms and reduce the death rate. We conducted literature mining of more than 250 thousand published works and curated the 174 most widely used COVID-19 medications. Overlaid with the human protein-protein interaction(PPI) network, we used Steiner tree analysis to extract a core subnetwork thatgrew from the pharmacological targets of ten credible drugs ascertained by theCTD database. The resultant core subnetwork consisted of 34 interconnected genes,which were associated with 36 drugs. Immune cell membrane receptors, thedownstream cellular signaling cascade, and severe COVID-19 symptom risk weresignificantly enriched for the core subnetwork genes. The lung mast cell was mostenriched for the target genes among 1355 human tissue-cell types. Humanbronchoalveolar lavage fluid COVID-19 single-cell RNA-Seq data highlighted thefact that T cells and macrophages have the most overlapping genes from the coresubnetwork. Overall, we constructed an actionable human target-protein modulethat mainly involved anti-inflammatory/antiviral entry functions and highlyoverlapped with COVID-19-severity-related genes. Our findings could serve as aknowledge base for guiding drug discovery or drug repurposing to confront thefast-evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus and other severe infectious diseases.

TI  - Diminazene Aceturate Reduces Angiotensin II Constriction and Interacts with theSpike Protein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2.
LID - 1731 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10071731 [doi]
AB  - Diminazene aceturate (DIZE) is a putative angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activator and angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonist (AT1R). Its simple chemical structure possesses a negatively charged triazene segment that is homologous tothe tetrazole of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), which explains its AT1Rantagonistic activity. Additionally, the activation of ACE2 by DIZE converts the toxic octapeptide angiotensin II (AngII) to the heptapeptides angiotensin 1-7 andalamandine, which promote vasodilation and maintains homeostatic balance. Due to DIZE's protective cardiovascular and pulmonary effects and its ability to target ACE2 (the predominant receptor utilized by severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 to enter host cells), it is a promising treatment for coronavirus2019 (COVID-19). To determine DIZE's ability to inhibit AngII constriction, invitro isometric tension analysis was conducted on rabbit iliac arteries incubatedwith DIZE or candesartan and constricted with cumulative doses of AngII. Insilico docking and ligand interaction studies were performed to investigatepotential interactions between DIZE and other ARBs with AT1R and the spikeprotein/ACE2 complex. DIZE, similar to the other ARBs investigated, was able toabolish vasoconstriction in response to AngII and exhibited a binding affinityfor the spike protein/ACE2 complex (PDB 6LZ6). These results support thepotential of DIZE as a treatment for COVID-19.

TI  - Saquinavir: From HIV to COVID-19 and Cancer Treatment.

AB  - Saquinavir was the first protease inhibitor developed for HIV therapy, and itchanged the standard of treatment for this disease to a combination of drugs thatultimately led to increased survival of this otherwise deadly condition.Inhibiting the HIV protease impedes the virus from maturing and replicating. Withthis in mind, since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, the research for already approved drugs (mainly antivirals) to repurpose for treatment of this disease hasincreased. Among the drugs tested, saquinavir showed promise in silico and invitro in the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro). Another fieldfor saquinavir repurposing has been in anticancer treatment, in which it hasshown effects in vitro and in vivo in several types of cancer, from Kaposicarcinoma to neuroblastoma, demonstrating cytotoxicity, apoptosis, inhibition of cell invasion, and improvement of radiosensibility of cancer cells. Despite thelack of follow-up in clinical trials for cancer use, there has been a renewedinterest in this drug recently due to COVID-19, which shows similarpharmacological pathways and has developed superior in silico models that can be translated to oncologic research. This could help further testing and futureapproval of saquinavir repurposing for cancer treatment.

AB  - The use of US FDA-approved drugs is preferred due to the need for lower costs andless time. In in silico medicine, repurposing is a quick and accurate way toscreen US FDA-approved medications to find a therapeutic option for COVID-19infection. Dual inhibitors possess dual inhibitory activity, which may be due to the inhibition of two different enzymes, and are considered better thancombination therapy from the developmental and clinical perspectives. In thisstudy, a molecular docking simulation was performed to identify the interactions of antiviral drugs with the critical residues in the binding site of the mainSARS-CoV-2 protease, spike glycoprotein, and papain-like protease receptorscompared to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-related carboxypeptidase (ACE2)receptor of host cells. Each of the receptors was docked with 70 US FDA-approved antiviral drugs using AutoDock Vina. A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studywas also used for 100 ns to confirm the stability behaviour of the ligandreceptor complexes. Among the drugs that had the strongest interaction with theSARS-CoV-2 main protease, spike glycoprotein and papain-like protease receptors, and host cell ACE2 receptors, Simeprevir, Maraviroc and Saquinavir had dualinhibitory effects. The MD simulation study confirmed the stability of thestrongest interactions between the antiviral drugs and the main protease, ACE2,spike glycoprotein, and papain-like protease receptors to 100 ns. However theresults of MMPBSA analysis showed that the bond between Saquinavir and the ACE2receptor was weak. Simeprevir and Maraviroc drugs had acceptable binding energieswith dual receptors, especially the Simeprevir.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.Sarma.

TI  - Drug repurposing based on a quantum-inspired method versus classicalfingerprinting uncovers potential antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
PG  - e1010330
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010330 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need to identify new antiviraltherapeutics at pace, including through drug repurposing. We employed a QuadraticUnbounded Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, to search for compounds similar toRemdesivir, the first antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 approved for human use, using a quantum-inspired device. We modelled Remdesivir and compounds present in theDrugBank database as graphs, established the optimal parameters in our algorithm and resolved the Maximum Weighted Independent Set problem within the conflictgraph generated. We also employed a traditional Tanimoto fingerprint model. Thetwo methods yielded different lists of lead compounds, with some overlap. WhileGS-6620 was the top compound predicted by both models, the QUBO model predictedBMS-986094 as second best. The Tanimoto model predicted different forms ofcobalamin, also known as vitamin B12. We then determined the half maximalinhibitory concentration (IC50) values in cell culture models of SARS-CoV-2infection and assessed cytotoxicity. We also demonstrated efficacy againstseveral variants including SARS-CoV-2 Strain England 2 (England 02/2020/407073), B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta) and B.1.617.2 (Delta). Lastly, we employed an in vitro polymerization assay to demonstrate that these compounds directly inhibitthe RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of SARS-CoV-2. Together, our data reveal that our QUBO model performs accurate comparisons (BMS-986094) that differed fromthose predicted by Tanimoto (different forms of vitamin B12); all compoundsinhibited replication of SARS-CoV-2 via direct action on RdRP, with both modelsbeing useful. While Tanimoto may be employed when performing relatively smallcomparisons, QUBO is also accurate and may be well suited for very complexproblems where computational resources may limit the number and/or complexity of possible combinations to evaluate. Our quantum-inspired screening method cantherefore be employed in future searches for novel pharmacologic inhibitors, thusproviding an approach for accelerating drug deployment.

AB  - COVID-19 has become a pandemic, and any new drug for treating the disease couldsave millions of lives. Several drugs already in use for other diseases andmedical conditions are repurposed for treating COVID-19 in an attempt to findtreatment for the disease without spending research time on ADME TOX and otherstudies on side effects. In this exercise, the drugs repurposed are fromantiviral, antibiotics, antiviral for HIV and HCV, anti-cancer, naturalmedicines, etc. Possible repurposing anti-diabetic GPR-120 agonists used as forSAR-CoV-2 is attempted in the study by carrying out docking of 68 GPR-120agonists. Ten of these compounds were found to have docking scores -8.3 to -8.0, and the best docking score was observed for an arylsulfonamide and abiarylpropanoic acid belonging to GPR120 agonists previously evaluated for thetreatment of type II diabetes. These GPR120 agonists could serve as start pointfor novel inhibitors for the discovery of drugs to treat COVID-19.

AB  - The first cases of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, were detected in December2019 in Wuhan, China. Nucleotide substitutions and mutations in the SARS-CoV-2sequence can result in the evolution of the virus and its rapid spread across theworld. Therefore, understanding genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 and targeting the conserved elements responsible for viral replication have great benefits fordetecting its infection sources and diagnosing and treating COVID-19. In thisstudy, we used the SARS-CoV-2 sequence isolated from a 59-year-old man inArdabil, Iran, in April 2020 and sequenced using Oxford Nanopore technology. Ameta-analysis comparing the sequence under study with other sequences from Iranindicated long nucleotide insertions/deletions (indels) that code for NSP15, the NSP14-NSP10 complex, open reading frame ORF9b, and ORF1ab polyproteins. Inaddition, replicating the NSP8 protein in the study sequence is another topicthat can affect viral replication. Then using the DNA structure of NSP8, NSP15,NSP14-NSP10 complex, and ORF1ab as a genetic target can help find drug-likecompounds for COVID-19. Potential drug-like compounds reported in this study for their mechanism of action and interactions with SARS-CoV-2 genes using drugrepurposing are resveratrol, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, indomethacin,ciclesonide, and PDE4 inhibitor. Ciclesonide appears to show the best resultswhen docked with chosen viral proteins. Therefore, different proteins isolatedfrom nucleotide mutations in the virus sequence can indicate distinct inducersfor antibodies and are important in vaccine design.

TI  - The Anti-Histamine Azelastine, Identified by Computational Drug Repurposing,Inhibits Infection by Major Variants of SARS-CoV-2 in Cell Cultures andReconstituted Human Nasal Tissue.
PG  - 861295
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.861295 [doi]
AB  - Background and purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose challenges,especially with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants that are associated withhigher infectivity and/or compromised protection afforded by the currentvaccines. There is a high demand for additional preventive and therapeuticstrategies effective against this changing virus. Repurposing of approved orclinically tested drugs can provide an immediate solution. Experimental Approach:We applied a novel computational approach to search among approved andcommercially available drugs. Antiviral activity of a predicted drug, azelastine,was tested in vitro in SARS-CoV-2 infection assays with Vero E6 cells, Vero cellsstably overexpressing the human TMPRSS2 and ACE2 proteins as well as onreconstituted human nasal tissue using the predominant variant circulating inEurope in summer 2020, B.1.177 (D614G variant), and its emerging variants ofconcern; B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.617.2 (delta) variants. Theeffect of azelastine on viral replication was assessed by quantification of viralgenomes by droplet digital PCR or qPCR. Key results: The computational approachidentified major drug families, such as anti-infective, anti-inflammatory,anti-hypertensive, antihistamine, and neuroactive drugs. Based on its attractive safety profile and availability in nasal formulation, azelastine, a histamine 1receptor-blocker was selected for experimental testing. Azelastine reduced thevirus-induced cytopathic effect and SARS-CoV-2 copy numbers both in preventiveand treatment settings upon infection of Vero cells with an EC50 of 2.2-6.5microM. Comparable potency was observed with the alpha, beta and delta variants. Furthermore, five-fold dilution (containing 0.02% azelastine) of the commerciallyavailable nasal spray formulation was highly potent in inhibiting viralpropagation in reconstituted human nasal tissue. Conclusion and Implications:Azelastine, an antihistamine available as nasal sprays developed against allergicrhinitis may be considered as a topical prevention or treatment of nasalcolonization by SARS-CoV-2. A Phase 2 efficacy indicator study withazelastine-containing nasal spray that was designed based on the findingsreported here has been concluded recently, confirming accelerated viral clearancein SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic the worldexperience since 2019. The protein responsible for the first steps of cellinvasion, the spike protein, has probably received the most attention in light ofits central role during infection. Computational approaches are among the toolsemployed by the scientific community in the enormous effort to study this newaffliction. One of these methods, namely molecular dynamics (MD), has been usedto characterize the function of the spike protein at the atomic level and unveil its structural features from a dynamic perspective. In this review, we focus onthese main findings, including spike protein flexibility, rare S proteinconformational changes, cryptic epitopes, the role of glycans, drug repurposing, and the effect of spike protein variants.

AB  - The prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading cause of death from asingle infectious agent, ranking it above all other contagious diseases. Theproblem to tackle this disease seems to become even worse due to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Further, the complications related to drug-resistant TB, prolongedtreatment regimens, and synergy between TB and HIV are significant drawbacks.There are several drugs to treat TB, but there is still no rapid and accuratetreatment available. Intensive research is, therefore, necessary to discovernewer molecular analogs that can probably eliminate this disease within a shortspan. An increase in efficacy can be achieved through re-engineering old TB-drug families and repurposing known drugs. These two approaches have led to theproduction of newer classes of compounds with novel mechanisms to treatmultidrug-resistant strains. With respect to this context, we discuss structural aspects of developing new anti-TB drugs as well as examine advances in TB drugdiscovery. It was found that the fluoroquinolone, oxazolidinone, andnitroimidazole classes of compounds have greater potential to be further exploredfor TB drug development. Most of the TB drug candidates in the clinical phase aremodified versions of these classes of compounds. Therefore, here we anticipatethat modification or repurposing of these classes of compounds has a higherprobability to reach the clinical phase of drug development. The informationprovided will pave the way for researchers to design and identify newer molecularanalogs for TB drug development and also broaden the scope of exploringfuture-generation potent, yet safer anti-TB drugs.

AB  - A virus enters a living organism and recruits host metabolism to reproduce itsown genome and proteins. The viral infections are intricate and cannot becompletely removed through existing antiviral drugs. For example, the herpes,influenza, hepatitis and human immunodeficiency viruses are a few dreadful onesamongst them. Significant studies are needed to understand the viral entry andtheir growth in host cells to design effective antivirals. This review emphasizesthe range of therapeutical antiviral drugs, inhibitors along with vaccines tofight against viral pathogens, especially for combating COVID-19. Moreover, wehave provided the basic and in depth information about viral targets, drugsavailability, their mechanisms of action, method of prevention of viral diseases and highlighted the significances of anticoagulants, convalescent plasma forCOVID-19 treatment, scientific details of airborne transmission, characteristics of antiviral drug delivery using nanoparticles/carriers, nanoemulsions, nanogels,metal based nanoparticles, alike the future nanosystems through nanobubbles,nanofibers, nanodiamonds, nanotraps, nanorobots and eventually, the therapeuticapplications of micro- and nanoparticulates, current status for clinicaldevelopment against COVID-19 together with environmental implications ofantivirals, gene therapy etc., which may be useful for repurposing and designing of novel antiviral drugs against various dreadful diseases, especially theSARS-CoV-2 and other associated variants.

AB  - Introduction: COVID-19 is a major health threat around the world causing hundredsof millions of infections and millions of deaths. There is a pressing global needfor effective therapies. We hypothesized that leukotriene inhibitors (LTIs), thathave been shown to lower IL6 and IL8 levels, may have a protective effect inpatients with COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective controlled cohort study,we compared death rates in COVID-19 patients who were taking a LTI with those whowere not taking an LTI. We used the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) CorporateData Warehouse (CDW) to create a cohort of COVID-19-positive patients and trackedtheir use of LTIs between November 1, 2019 and November 11, 2021. Results: Of the1,677,595 cohort of patients tested for COVID-19, 189,195 patients testedpositive for COVID-19. Forty thousand seven hundred one were admitted. 38,184 hadan oxygen requirement and 1214 were taking an LTI. The use of dexamethasone plus a LTI in hospital showed a survival advantage of 13.5% (CI: 0.23%-26.7%; p <0.01) in patients presenting with a minimal O2Sat of 50% or less. For patientswith an O2Sat of <60 and <50% if they were on LTIs as outpatients, continuing theLTI led to a 14.4% and 22.25 survival advantage if they were continued on themedication as inpatients. Conclusions: When combined dexamethasone and LTIsprovided a mortality benefit in COVID-19 patients presenting with an O2saturations <50%. The LTI cohort had lower markers of inflammation and cytokinestorm.

AB  - COVID-19 is a global pandemic impacting the daily living of millions. As variantsof the virus evolve, a complete comprehension of the disease and drug targetsbecomes a decisive duty. The Omicron variant, for example, has a notably hightransmission rate verified in 155 countries. We performed integrativetranscriptomic and network analyses to identify drug targets and diagnosticbiomarkers and repurpose FDA-approved drugs for SARS-CoV-2. Upon the enrichmentof 464 differentially expressed genes, pathways regulating the host cell cyclewere significant. Regulatory and interaction networks featured hsa-mir-93-5p and hsa-mir-17-5p as blood biomarkers while hsa-mir-15b-5p as an antiviral agent.MYB, RRM2, ERG, CENPF, CIT, and TOP2A are potential drug targets for treatment.HMOX1 is suggested as a prognostic biomarker. Enhancing HMOX1 expression by neem plant extract might be a therapeutic alternative. We constructed a drug-genenetwork for FDA-approved drugs to be repurposed against the infection. The keydrugs retrieved were members of anthracyclines, mitotic inhibitors, anti-tumorantibiotics, and CDK1 inhibitors. Additionally, hydroxyquinone and digitoxin are potent TOP2A inhibitors. Hydroxyurea, cytarabine, gemcitabine, sotalol, andamiodarone can also be redirected against COVID-19. The analysis enforced therepositioning of fluorouracil and doxorubicin, especially that they have multipledrug targets, hence less probability of resistance.

AB  - Worldwide, there are intensive efforts to identify repurposed drugs as potential therapies against SARS-CoV-2 infection and the associated COVID-19 disease. Todate, the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone and (to a lesser extent) theRNA-polymerase inhibitor remdesivir have been shown to be effective in reducingmortality and patient time to recovery, respectively, in patients. Here, wereport the results of a phenotypic screening campaign within an EU-funded project(H2020-EXSCALATE4COV) aimed at extending the repertoire of anti-COVIDtherapeutics through repurposing of available compounds and highlightingcompounds with new mechanisms of action against viral infection. We screened 8702molecules from different repurposing libraries, to reveal 110 compounds with ananti-cytopathic IC50 < 20 microM. From this group, 18 with a safety index greaterthan 2 are also marketed drugs, making them suitable for further study aspotential therapies against COVID-19. Our result supports the idea that asystematic approach to repurposing is a valid strategy to accelerate thenecessary drug discovery process.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been circulatingsince 2019, and its global dominance is rising. Evidences suggest the respiratoryillness SARS-CoV-2 has a sensitive affect on causing organ damage and othercomplications to the patients with autoimmune diseases (AD), posing a significantrisk factor. The genetic interrelationships and molecular appearances betweenSARS-CoV-2 and AD are yet unknown. We carried out the transcriptomic analyticalframework to delve into the SARS-CoV-2 impacts on AD progression. We analyzedboth gene expression microarray and RNA-Seq datasets from SARS-CoV-2 and ADaffected tissues. With neighborhood-based benchmarks and multilevel networktopology, we obtained dysfunctional signaling and ontological pathways, genedisease (diseasesome) association network and protein-protein interaction network(PPIN), uncovered essential shared infection recurrence connectivities withbiological insights underlying between SARS-CoV-2 and AD. We found a total of 77,21, 9, 54 common DEGs for SARS-CoV-2 and inflammatory bowel disorder (IBD),SARS-CoV-2 and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), SARS-CoV-2 and systemic lupuserythematosus (SLE) and SARS-CoV-2 and type 1 diabetes (T1D). The enclosure ofthese common DEGs with bimolecular networks revealed 10 hub proteins (FYN, VEGFA,CTNNB1, KDR, STAT1, B2M, CD3G, ITGAV, TGFB3). Drugs such as amlodipine besylate, vorinostat, methylprednisolone, and disulfiram have been identified as a commonground between SARS-CoV-2 and AD from drug repurposing investigation which willstimulate the optimal selection of medications in the battle against this ongoingpandemic triggered by COVID-19.

AB  - Due to the emergency and uncontrolled situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemicthat arising in the entire world, it is necessary to choose available drugs that can inhibit or prevent the disease. Therefore, the repurposing of the commercial antibiotic, dirithromycin has been screened for the first time against fifteenreceptors and compared to the azithromycin using a molecular docking approach to identify possible SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. Our docking results showed thatdirithromycin fit significantly in the Furin catalytic pocket having the lowestbinding score (-9.9 Kcal/mol) with respect to azithromycin (-9.4 Kcal/mol) andcan interact and block both Asp154 and Ser368 residues by Van der Wallsinteraction as well as bound to His194 and Ser368 residues via hydrogen bonds.Good results were also obtained with the Tmprss-2 receptor. A Molecular Dynamicsimulation was assessed to confirm this interaction. Additionally, detailedreceptor-ligand interactions with SARS-CoV-2 and pro-inflammatory mediators were investigated suggesting more target information with interesting results. Thefindings of this study are very efficient and provide a basis for the developmentof dirithromycin for clinical trial applications to be efficient in treatingSARS-CoV-2 infections.

AB  - Despite the accelerated emerging of vaccines, development against the severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) drugs discovery is still indemand. Repurposing the existing drugs is an ideal time/cost-effective strategyto tackle the clinical impact of SARS CoV-2. Thereby, the present study is apromising strategy that proposes the repurposing of approved drugs againstpivotal proteins that are responsible for the viral propagation of SARS-CoV-2virus Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2; 2AJF), 3CL-protease: main protease(6LU7), Papain-like protease (6W9C), Receptor Binding Domain of Spike protein(6VW1), Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS-2; 5AFW) and Furin (5MIM) by insilico methods. Molecular docking results were analyzed based on the bindingenergy and active site interactions accomplished with pharmacokinetic analysis.It was observed that both anisomycin and oleandomycin bind to all selected targetproteins with good binding energy, achieving the most favorable interactions.Considering the results of binding affinity, pharmacokinetics and toxicity ofanisomycin and oleandomycin, it is proposed that they can act as potential drugs against the SARS CoV-2 infection. Further clinical testing of the reported drugs is essential for their use in the treatment of SARS CoV-2 infection.

LID - 10.1093/bib/bbac272 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we introduce an interpretable graph-based deep learning predictionmodel, AttentionSiteDTI, which utilizes protein binding sites along with aself-attention mechanism to address the problem of drug-target interactionprediction. Our proposed model is inspired by sentence classification models inthe field of Natural Language Processing, where the drug-target complex istreated as a sentence with relational meaning between its biochemical entitiesa.k.a. protein pockets and drug molecule. AttentionSiteDTI enablesinterpretability by identifying the protein binding sites that contribute themost toward the drug-target interaction. Results on three benchmark datasets showimproved performance compared with the current state-of-the-art models. Moresignificantly, unlike previous studies, our model shows superior performance,when tested on new proteins (i.e. high generalizability). Throughmultidisciplinary collaboration, we further experimentally evaluate the practicalpotential of our proposed approach. To achieve this, we first computationallypredict the binding interactions between some candidate compounds and a targetprotein, then experimentally validate the binding interactions for these pairs inthe laboratory. The high agreement between the computationally predicted andexperimentally observed (measured) drug-target interactions illustrates thepotential of our method as an effective pre-screening tool in drug repurposingapplications.

AB  - The rapid spread of COVID-19 has caused a worldwide public health crisis. Forprompt and effective development of antivirals for SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen ofCOVID-19, drug repurposing has been broadly conducted by targeting the mainprotease (M(Pro)), a key enzyme responsible for the replication of virus insidethe host. In this study, we evaluate the inhibition potency of anitrothiazole-containing drug, halicin, and reveal its reaction and interactionmechanism with M(Pro). The in vitro potency test shows that halicin inhibits the activity of M(Pro) an IC50 of 181.7 nM. Native mass spectrometry and X-raycrystallography studies clearly indicate that the nitrothiazole fragment ofhalicin covalently binds to the catalytic cysteine C145 of M(Pro). Interactionand conformational changes inside the active site of M(Pro) suggest a favorablenucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction mechanism between M(Pro) C145 andhalicin, explaining the high inhibition potency of halicin towards M(Pro).

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused theworldwide spread of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), and till now, it hascaused death to more than 6.2 million people. Although various vaccines and drug candidates are being tested globally with limited to moderate success, acomprehensive therapeutic cure is yet to be achieved. In this study, we appliedcomputational drug repurposing methods complemented with the analyses of thealready existing gene expression data to find better therapeutics in treatmentand recovery. Primarily, we identified the most crucial proteins of SARS-CoV-2and host human cells responsible for viral infection and host response. Anin-silico screening of the existing drugs was performed against the crucialproteins for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a few existing drugs were shortlisted.Further, we analyzed the gene expression data of SARS-CoV-2 in human lungepithelial cells and investigated the molecules that can reverse the cellularmRNA expression profiles in the diseased state. LINCS L1000 and ComparativeToxicogenomics Database (CTD) were utilized to obtain two sets of compounds that can be used to counter SARS-CoV-2 infection from the gene expression perspective.Indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and Vitamin-A werefound in two sets of compounds, and in the in-silico screening of existing drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2. Our in-silico findings on Indomethacin were furthersuccessfully validated by in-vitro testing in Vero CCL-81 cells with an IC50 of12 muM. Along with these findings, we briefly discuss the possible roles ofIndomethacin and Vitamin-A to counter the SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.

TI  - Vitamin D Endocrine System and COVID-19: Treatment with Calcifediol.
LID - 2716 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14132716 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest challenge facing modern medicine and publichealth systems. The viral evolution of SARS-CoV-2, with the emergence of newvariants with in-creased infectious potential, is a cause for concern. Inaddition, vaccination coverage remains in-sufficient worldwide. Therefore, there is a need to develop new therapeutic options, and/or to optimize therepositioning of drugs approved for other indications for COVID-19. This mayinclude the use of calcifediol, the prohormone of the vitamin D endocrine system (VDES) as it may have potential useful effects for the treatment of COVID-19. We review the aspects associating COVID-19 with VDES and the potential use ofcalcifediol in COVID-19. VDES/VDR stimulation may enhance innate antiviraleffector mechanisms, facilitating the induction of antimicrobialpeptides/autophagy, with a critical modulatory role in the subsequent hostreactive hyperinflammatory phase during COVID-19: By decreasing thecytokine/chemokine storm, regulating the renin-angiotensin-bradykinin system(RAAS), modulating neutrophil activity and maintaining the integrity of thepulmonary epithelial barrier, stimulating epithelial repair, and directly andindirectly decreasing the increased coagulability and prothrombotic tendencyassociated with severe COVID-19 and its complications. Available evidencesuggests that VDES/VDR stimulation, while maintaining optimal serum 25OHD status,in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may significantly reduce the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe COVID-19, with possiblebeneficial effects on the need for mechanical ventilation and/or intensive careunit (ICU) admission, as well as deaths in the course of the disease. Thepharmacokinetic and functional characteristics of calcifediol give it superiorityin rapidly optimizing 25OHD levels in COVID-19. A pilot study and severalobservational intervention studies using high doses of calcifediol (0.532 mg onday 1 and 0.266 mg on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28) dramatically decreased the need for ICU admission and the mortality rate. We, therefore, propose to usecalcifediol at the doses described for the rapid correction of 25OHD deficiencyin all patients in the early stages of COVID-19, in association, if necessary,with the new oral antiviral agents.

TI  - Microbial Natural Products with Antiviral Activities, Including Anti-SARS-CoV-2: A Review.
LID - 4305 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27134305 [doi]
AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which caused the COVID-19 infection, was discovered two anda half years ago. It caused a global pandemic, resulting in millions of deathsand substantial damage to the worldwide economy. Currently, only a few vaccinesand antiviral drugs are available to combat SARS-CoV-2. However, there has beenan increase in virus-related research, including exploring new drugs and theirrepurposing. Since discovering penicillin, natural products, particularly thosederived from microbes, have been viewed as an abundant source of lead compoundsfor drug discovery. These compounds treat bacterial, fungal, parasitic, and viralinfections. This review incorporates evidence from the available researchpublications on isolated and identified natural products derived from microbeswith anti-hepatitis, anti-herpes simplex, anti-HIV, anti-influenza,anti-respiratory syncytial virus, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties. About 131compounds with in vitro antiviral activity and 1 compound with both in vitro and in vivo activity have been isolated from microorganisms, and the mechanism ofaction for some of these compounds has been described. Recent reports have shown that natural products produced by the microbes, such as aurasperone A,neochinulin A and B, and aspulvinone D, M, and R, have potent in vitroanti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, targeting the main protease (M(pro)). In the near anddistant future, these molecules could be used to develop antiviral drugs fortreating infections and preventing the spread of disease.

TI  - From Repurposing to Redesign: Optimization of Boceprevir to Highly PotentInhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease.
LID - 4292 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27134292 [doi]
AB  - The main protease (M(pro)) of the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is an attractivetarget for the development of treatments for COVID-19. Structure-based design is a successful approach to discovering new inhibitors of the M(pro). Starting from crystal structures of the M(pro) in complexes with the Hepatitis C virus NS3/4Aprotease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir, we optimized the potency of thealpha-ketoamide boceprevir against the M(pro) by replacing its P1 cyclobutylmoiety by a gamma-lactam as a glutamine surrogate. The resulting compound, MG-78,exhibited an IC50 of 13 nM versus the recombinant M(pro), and similar potency wasobserved for its P1' N-methyl derivative MG-131. Crystal structures confirmed thevalidity of our design concept. In addition to SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) inhibition, wealso explored the activity of MG-78 against the M(pro) of the alphacoronavirusHCoV NL63 and against enterovirus 3C proteases. The activities were good (0.33microM, HCoV-NL63 M(pro)), moderate (1.45 microM, Coxsackievirus 3C(pro)), andrelatively poor (6.7 microM, enterovirus A71 3C(pro)), respectively. Thestructural basis for the differences in activities was revealed by X-raycrystallo-graphy. We conclude that the modified boceprevir scaffold is suitablefor obtaining high-potency inhibitors of the coronavirus M(pro)s but furtheroptimization would be needed to target enterovirus 3C(pro)s efficiently.

AB  - Treatment options for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain limited, and theoption of repurposing approved drugs with promising medicinal properties is ofincreasing interest in therapeutic approaches to COVID-19. Using computationalapproaches, we examined griseofulvin and its derivatives against four keyanti-SARS-CoV-2 targets: main protease, RdRp, spike protein receptor-bindingdomain (RBD), and human host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Moleculardocking analysis revealed that griseofulvin (CID 441140) has the highest docking score (-6.8 kcal/mol) with main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, griseofulvinderivative M9 (CID 144564153) proved the most potent inhibitor with -9.49kcal/mol, followed by A3 (CID 46844082) with -8.44 kcal/mol against M proteaseand ACE2, respectively. Additionally, H bond analysis revealed that compound A3formed the highest number of hydrogen bonds, indicating the strongest inhibitory efficacy against ACE2. Further, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysisrevealed that griseofulvin and these derivatives are structurally stable. Thesefindings suggest that griseofulvin and its derivatives may be considered whendesigning future therapeutic options for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing thecoronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is still challenging healthcare systems andsocieties worldwide. While vaccines are available, therapeutic strategies aredeveloping and need to be adapted to each patient. Many clinical approaches focuson the repurposing of approved therapeutics against other diseases. However, the efficacy of these compounds on viral infection or even harmful secondary effects in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection are sparsely investigated. Similarly,adverse effects of commonly used therapeutics against lifestyle diseases have notbeen studied in detail. Using mono cell culture systems and a more complex chipmodel, we investigated the effects of the acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) saltD,L-lysine-acetylsalicylate + glycine (LASAG) on SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.ASA is commonly known as Aspirin((R)) and is one of the most frequently usedmedications worldwide. Our data indicate an inhibitory effect of LASAG onSARS-CoV-2 replication and SARS-CoV-2-induced expression of pro-inflammatorycytokines and coagulation factors. Remarkably, our data point to an additiveeffect of the combination of LASAG and the antiviral acting drug remdesivir onSARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro.

AB  - COVID-19 is marked by extensive damage to the respiratory system, oftenaccompanied by systemic manifestations, due to both viral cytopathic effects and hyperinflammatory syndrome. Therefore, the development of new therapeuticstrategies or drug repurposing aiming to control virus replication andinflammation are required to mitigate the impact of the disease.Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-BCD) is a cholesterol-sequestering agent withantiviral activity that has been demonstrated against enveloped viruses in invitro and in vivo experimental models. We also demonstrated that HP-BCD has animmunomodulatory effect, inhibiting the production of selected proinflammatorycytokines induced by microbial products. Importantly, this drug has been used in humans for decades as an excipient in drug delivery systems and as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of Niemann pick C disease. The safety profile for thiscompound is well established. Here, we investigated whether HP-BCD would affectSARS-CoV-2 replication and virus-induced inflammatory response, using establishedcell lines and primary human cells. Treating virus or cells with HP-BCDsignificantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication with a high selective index. Abroad activity against distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants was evidenced by a remarkablereduction in the release of infectious particles. The drug did not alter ACE2surface expression, but affected cholesterol accumulation into intracellularreplication complexes, lowering virus RNA and protein levels, and reducingvirus-induced cytopathic effects. Virus replication was also impaired by HP-BCDin Calu-3 pulmonary cell line and human primary monocytes, in which not only the virus, but also the production of proinflammatory cytokines were significantlyinhibited. Given the pathophysiology of COVID-19 disease, these data indicatethat the use HP-BCD, which inhibits both SARS-CoV2 replication and production of proinflammatory cytokines, as a potential COVID-19 therapeutic warrants furtherinvestigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic witha high mortality and morbidity rate worldwide. The COVID-19 vaccines that arecurrently in development or already approved are expected to provide at leastsome protection against the emerging variants of the virus, but the mutations mayreduce the efficacy of the existing vaccines. Purified phytochemicals frommedicinal plants provide a helpful framework for discovering new therapeuticleads as they have long been employed in traditional medicine to treat manydisorders. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the study are to exploit the anti-HIVbioactive compounds against SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)through molecular docking studies and to evaluate the Absorption, Distribution,Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) properties of potential compounds.METHODS: Molecular docking was performed to study the interaction of ligands withthe target sites of RdRp protein (PDB: 6M71) using AutoDock Vina. The ADMETproperties of potential compounds were predicted using the pkCSM platform.RESULTS: A total of 151 phytochemicals derived from the medicinal plants withrecognized antiviral activity and 18 anti-HIV drugs were virtually screenedagainst COVID-19 viral RdRp to identify putative inhibitors that facilitate thedevelopment of potential anti-COVID-19 drug candidates. The computational studiesidentified 34 compounds and three drugs inhibiting viral RdRp with bindingenergies ranging from -10.2 to -8.5 kcal/mol. Among them, five compounds, namely Michellamine B, Quercetin 3-O-(2'',6''-digalloyl)-beta-Dgalactopyranoside,Corilagin, Hypericin, and 1,2,3,4,6-Penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose residues,bound efficiently with the binding site of RdRp. Besides, Lopinavir, Maraviroc,and Remdesivir drugs also inhibited SARS-CoV-2 polymerase. In addition, the ADMETproperties of top potential compounds were also predicted in comparison to thedrugs. CONCLUSION: The present study suggested that these potential drugcandidates can be further subjected to in vitro and in vivo studies that may helpdevelop effective anti-COVID-19 drugs.

AB  - The recent outbreak "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)" is caused byfast-spreading and highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). This virus enters into the human respiratory system bybinding of the viral surface spike glycoprotein (S-protein) to anangiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) receptor that is found in the nasal passageand oral cavity of a human. Both spike protein and the ACE2 receptor have beenidentified as promising therapeutic targets to develop anti-SARS-CoV2 drugs. Notherapeutic drugs have been developed as of today except for some vaccines.Therefore, potent therapeutic agents are urgently needed to combat the COVID-19infections. This goal would be achieved only by applying drug repurposing andcomputational approaches. Thus, based on drug repurposing approach, we haveinvestigated 16 bioactive components (1-16) from different nasal spray solutions to check their efficacies against human ACE2 and SARS-CoV2 spike proteins byperforming molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation studies. Inthis study, three bioactive components namely ciclesonide (8), levocabastine(13), and triamcinolone acetonide (16) have been found as promising inhibitoryagents against SARS-CoV2 spike and human ACE2 receptor proteins with excellentbinding affinities, comparing to reference drugs such as nafamostat, arbidol,losartan, and benazepril. Furthermore, MD simulations were performed (triplicate)for 100 ns to confirm the stability of 8, 13, and 16 with said protein targetsand to compute MM-PBSA-based binding-free energy calculations. Thus, bioactivecomponents 8, 13, and 16 open the door for researchers and scientist globally to investigate them against SARS-CoV2 through in vitro and in vivo analysis.

AB  - A virus called severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus type 2(SARS-CoV-2) is the causing organism of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),which has severely affected human life and threatened public health. The pandemictook millions of lives worldwide and caused serious negative effects on humansociety and the economy. SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and RNA-dependent RNApolymerase (RdRp) are interesting targets due to their crucial role in viralreplication and growth. Since there is only one approved therapy for COVID-19,drug repurposing is a promising approach to finding molecules with potentialactivity against COVID-19 in a short time and at minimal cost. In this study,virtual screening was performed on the ChEMBL library containing 9923FDA-approved drugs, using various docking filters with different accuracy. Thebest drugs with the highest docking scores were further examined for moleculardynamics (MD) studies and MM-GBSA calculations. The results of this study suggestthat nadide, cangrelor and denufosol are promising potential candidates againstCOVID-19. Further in vitro, preclinical and clinical studies of these candidates would help to discover safe and effective anti-COVID-19 drugs.

AB  - Analogues and derivatives of natural nucleosides/nucleotides are considered amongthe most successful bioactive species of drug-like compounds in modern medicinal chemistry, as they are well recognized for their diverse and efficientpharmacological activities in humans, especially as antivirals and antitumors.Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still almost incurable, with itsinfectious viral microbe, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2), continuing to wreak devastation around the world. This globalcrisis pushed all involved scientists, including drug discoverers and clinicalresearchers, to try to find an effective and broad-spectrum anti-COVID-19 drug.Didanosine (2',3'-dideoxyinosine, DDI) is a synthetic inosine/adenosine/guanosineanalogue and highly active antiretroviral therapeutic agent used for thetreatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immunodeficiencysyndrome (HIV/AIDS). This potent reverse-transcriptase inhibitor is characterizedby proven strong pharmacological effects against the viral genome, which maysuccessfully take part in the effective treatment of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19.Additionally, targeting the pivotal SARS-CoV-2 replication enzyme, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), is a very successful tactic to combat COVID-19irrespective of the SARS-CoV-2 variant type because RdRps are broadly conservedamong all SARS-CoV-2 strains. Herein, the current study proved for the firsttime, using the in vitro antiviral evaluation, that DDI is capable of potentlyinhibiting the replication of the novel virulent progenies of SARS-CoV-2 withquite tiny in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-RdRp EC50 values of around 3.1 and0.19 muM, respectively, surpassing remdesivir together with its active metabolite(GS-441524). Thereafter, the in silico computational interpretation of thebiological results supported that DDI strongly targets the key pocket of theSARS-CoV-2 RdRp main catalytic active site. The ideal pharmacophoriccharacteristics of the ligand DDI make it a typical inhibiting agent ofSARS-CoV-2 multiplication processes (including high-fidelity proofreading), with its elastic structure open for many kinds of derivatization. In brief, thepresent results further uphold and propose the repurposing potentials of DDIagainst the different types of COVID-19 and convincingly motivate us to quicklylaunch its extensive preclinical/clinical pharmacological evaluations, hoping to combine it in the COVID-19 therapeutic protocols soon.

AB  - The global spread of the SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), its manifestation inhuman hosts as a contagious disease, and its variants have induced a pandemicresulting in the deaths of over 6,000,000 people. Extensive efforts have beendevoted to drug research to cure and refrain the spread of COVID-19, but only onedrug has received FDA approval yet. Traditional drug discovery is inefficient,costly, and unable to react to pandemic threats. Drug repurposing represents aneffective strategy for drug discovery and reduces the time and cost compared tode novo drug discovery. In this study, a generic drug repurposing framework(SperoPredictor) has been developed which systematically integrates the varioustypes of drugs and disease data and takes the advantage of machine learning(Random Forest, Tree Ensemble, and Gradient Boosted Trees) to repurpose potentialdrug candidates against any disease of interest. Drug and disease data forFDA-approved drugs (n = 2,865), containing four drug features and three diseasefeatures, were collected from chemical and biological databases and integratedwith the form of drug-disease association tables. The resulting dataset was splitinto 70% for training, 15% for testing, and the remaining 15% for validation. Thetesting and validation accuracies of the models were 99.3% for Random Forest and 99.03% for Tree Ensemble. In practice, SperoPredictor identified 25 potentialdrug candidates against 6 human host-target proteomes identified from asystematic review of journals. Literature-based validation indicated 12 of 25predicted drugs (48%) have been already used for COVID-19 followed by moleculardocking and re-docking which indicated 4 of 13 drugs (30%) as potentialcandidates against COVID-19 to be pre-clinically and clinically validated.Finally, SperoPredictor results illustrated the ability of the platform to berapidly deployed to repurpose the drugs as a rapid response to emergentsituations (like COVID-19 and other pandemics).

AB  - Conventional drug discovery and development is tedious and time-taking process;because of which it has failed to keep the required pace to mitigate threats and cater demands of viral and re-occurring diseases, such as Covid-19. The mainreasons of this delay in traditional drug development are: high attrition rates, extensive time requirements, and huge financial investment with significant risk.The effective solution to de novo drug discovery is drug repurposing. Previousstudies have shown that the network-based approaches and analysis are versatileplatform for repurposing as the network biology is used to model the interactionsbetween variety of biological concepts. Herein, we provide a comprehensivebackground of machine learning and deep learning in drug repurposing whilespecifically focusing on the applications of network-based approach to drugrepurposing in Covid-19, data sources, and tools used. Furthermore, use ofnetwork proximity, network diffusion, and AI on network-based drug repurposingfor Covid-19 is well-explained. Finally, limitations of network-based approaches in general and specific to network are stated along with future recommendationsfor better network-based models.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 causes the current global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019.Widely-available effective drugs could be a critical factor in halting thepandemic. The main protease (3CLpro) plays a vital role in viral replication;therefore, it is of great interest to find inhibitors for this enzyme. We appliedthe combination of virtual screening based on molecular docking derived from the crystal structure of the peptidomimetic inhibitors (N3, 13b, and 11a), andexperimental verification revealed FDA-approved drugs that could inhibit the3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2. Three drugs were selected using the binding energy criteriaand subsequently performed the 3CLpro inhibition by enzyme-based assay. Inaddition, six common drugs were also chosen to study the 3CLpro inhibition. Amongthese compounds, lapatinib showed high efficiency of 3CLpro inhibition (IC50value of 35 +/- 1 muM and Ki of 23 +/- 1 muM). The binding behavior of lapatinib against 3CLpro was elucidated by molecular dynamics simulations. This drug could well bind with 3CLpro residues in the five subsites S1', S1, S2, S3, and S4.Moreover, lapatinib's key chemical pharmacophore features toward SAR-CoV-2 3CLproshared important HBD and HBA with potent peptidomimetic inhibitors. The rational design of lapatinib was subsequently carried out using the obtained results. Our discovery provides an effective repurposed drug and its newly designed analogs toinhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.

LID - 10.1002/bit.28166 [doi]
AB  - In the current pandemic, scenario the world is facing a huge shortage ofeffective drugs and other prophylactic medicine to treat patients which createdhavoc in several countries with poor resources. With limited demand and supply ofeffective drugs, researchers rushed to repurpose the existing approved drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. The process of drug screening and testing is verycostly and requires several steps for validation and treatment efficacyevaluation ranging from in-vitro to in-vivo setups. After these steps, a clinicaltrial is mandatory for the evaluation of treatment efficacy and side effects inhumans. These processes enhance the overall cost and sometimes the lead molecule show adverse effects in humans and the trial ends up in the final stages.Recently with the advent of three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture which mimics the human tissue exactly the process of drug screening and testing can be done ina faster and cost-effective manner. Further 3D organoids prepared from stemscells taken from individuals can be beneficial for personalized drug therapywhich could save millions of lives. This review discussed approaches andtechniques for the synthesis of 3D-printed human organoids for drug screening.The key findings of the usage of organoids for personalized medicine for thetreatment of COVID-19 have been discussed. In the end, the key challenges for thewide applicability of human organoids for drug screening with prospects of futureorientation have been included.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a pneumonia-likedisease with a pattern of acute respiratory symptoms, currently remains asignificant public health concern causing tremendous human suffering. Althoughseveral approved vaccines exist, vaccine hesitancy, limited vaccine availability,high rate of viral mutation, and the absence of approved drugs account for thepersistence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The investigation of possibly repurposingof phytochemical compounds as therapeutic alternatives has gained momentum due totheir reported affordability and minimal toxicity. This study investigatedanti-viral phytochemical compounds from ethanolic leaf extracts of Spondiasmombin L as potential inhibitor candidates against SARS-CoV-2. We identifiedGeraniin and 2-O-Caffeoyl-(+)-allohydroxycitric acid as potential SARS-CoV-2inhibitor candidates targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent polymerasereceptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 viral S-protein and the 3C-like main protease (3CL(pro)). Geraniin exhibited binding free energy (DeltaGbind) of -25.87 kcal/mol and - 21.74 kcal/mol towards SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent polymeraseand receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 viral S-protein respectively,whereas 2-O-Caffeoyl-(+)-allohydroxycitric acid exhibited a DeltaGbind of - 32kcal/mol towards 3CL(pro). Molecular Dynamics simulations indicated a possibleinterference to the functioning of SARS-CoV-2 targets by the two identifiedinhibitors. However, further in vitro and in vivo evaluation of these potentialSARS-CoV-2 therapeutic inhibitor candidates is needed.

AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to have high incidence and mortality rate globally. Tomeet the increasingly growing demand for new therapeutic drugs and vaccines,researchers are developing different diagnostic techniques focused on screeningnew drugs in clinical use, developing an antibody targeting a SARS-CoV-2receptor, or interrupting infection/replication mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2.Although many prestigious research publications are addressing this subject,there is no open access platform where all experimental techniques for COVID-19research can be seen as a whole. Many researchers have accelerated thedevelopment of in silico methods, high-throughput screening techniques, and invitro assays. This development has played an important role in the emergence ofimproved innovative strategies including different antiviral drug development,new drug discovery protocols, combinations of approved drugs, and setting up new drug classes during the COVID 19 outbreak. Hence, the present review discussesthe current literature on these modalities, including virtual in silico methodsfor instant ligand- and target-driven based techniques, nucleic acidamplification tests, and in vitro models based on sensitive cell cultures, tissueequivalents, organoids, and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization systems (lentiviralpseudotype, viral isolates, etc.). This pack of complementary tests informresearchers about the accurate, and most relevant emerging techniques available, and in vitro assays allowing them to understand their strengths and limitations. This review could be a pioneer reference guide for the development of logicalalgorithmic approaches for new drugs and vaccine strategies against COVID-19.

TI  - Repurposing Molnupiravir for COVID-19: The Mechanisms of Antiviral Activity.
LID - 1345 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14061345 [doi]
AB  - Molnupiravir is a beta-d-N4-hydroxycytidine-5'-isopropyl ester (NHC) compoundthat exerts antiviral activity against various RNA viruses such as influenza,SARS, and Ebola viruses. Thus, the repurposing of Molnupiravir has gainedsignificant attention for combatting infection with SARS-CoV-2, the etiologicalagent of COVID-19. Recently, Molnupiravir was granted authorization for thetreatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults. Findings from in vitroexperiments, in vivo studies and clinical trials reveal that Molnupiravir iseffective against SARS-CoV-2 by inducing viral RNA mutagenesis, thereby givingrise to mutated complementary RNA strands that generate non-functional viruses.To date, the data collectively suggest that Molnupiravir possesses promisingantiviral activity as well as favorable prophylactic efficacy, attributed to its effective mutagenic property of disrupting viral replication. This reviewdiscusses the mechanisms of action of Molnupiravir and highlights its clinicalutility by disabling SARS-CoV-2 replication, thereby ameliorating COVID-19severity. Despite relatively few short-term adverse effects thus far, furtherdetailed clinical studies and long-term pharmacovigilance are needed in view ofits mutagenic effects.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic began in 2019, but it is still active. The development ofan effective vaccine reduced the number of deaths; however, a treatment is still needed. Here, we aimed to inhibit viral entry to the host cell by inhibitingspike (S) protein cleavage by several proteases. We developed a computationalpipeline to repurpose FDA-approved drugs to inhibit protease activity and thusprevent S protein cleavage. We tested some of our drug candidates anddemonstrated a decrease in protease activity. We believe our pipeline will bebeneficial in identifying a drug regimen for COVID-19 patients.

TI  - The AI-Assisted Identification and Clinical Efficacy of Baricitinib in theTreatment of COVID-19.
LID - 951 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10060951 [doi]
AB  - During the current pandemic, the vast majority of COVID-19 patients experiencedmild symptoms, but some had a potentially fatal aberrant hyperinflammatory immunereaction characterized by high levels of IL-6 and other cytokines. Modulation of this immune reaction has proven to be the only method of reducing mortality insevere and critical COVID-19. The anti-inflammatory drug baricitinib (Olumiant)has recently been strongly recommended by the WHO for use in COVID-19 patientsbecause it reduces the risk of progressive disease and death. It is a JanusKinase (JAK) 1/2 inhibitor approved for rheumatoid arthritis which was suggested in early 2020 as a treatment for COVID-19. In this review the AI-assistedidentification of baricitinib, its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties,and efficacy in clinical trials are discussed and compared with those of otherimmune modulators including glucocorticoids, IL-6 and IL-1 receptor blockers and other JAK inhibitors. Baricitinib inhibits both virus infection and cytokinesignalling and is not only important for COVID-19 management but is"non-immunological", and so should remain effective if new SARS-CoV-2 variantsescape immune control. The repurposing of baricitinib is an example of howadvanced artificial intelligence (AI) can quickly identify new drug candidatesthat have clinical benefit in previously unsuspected therapeutic areas.

TI  - Development of Nafamostat Mesylate Immediate-Release Tablet by Drug RepositioningUsing Quality-by-Design Approach.
LID - 1219 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14061219 [doi]
AB  - We aimed to develop nafamostat mesylate immediate-release tablets for thetreatment of COVID-19 through drug repositioning studies of nafamostat mesylateinjection. Nafamostat mesylate is a serine protease inhibitor known to inhibitthe activity of the transmembrane protease, serine 2 enzyme that affects thepenetration of the COVID-19 virus, thereby preventing the binding of theangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in vivo and the spike protein of theCOVID-19 virus. The formulation was selected through a stability study aftermanufacturing by a wet granulation process and a direct tableting process todevelop a stable nafamostat mesylate immediate-release tablet. Formulation issuesfor the selected processes were addressed using the design of experiments andquality-by-design approaches. The dissolution rate of the developed tablet wasconfirmed to be &gt;90% within 30 min in the four major dissolutions, except inthe pH 6.8 dissolution medium. Additionally, an in vivo pharmacokinetic study wasperformed in monkeys, and the pharmacokinetic profiles of nafamostat injections, oral solutions, and tablets were compared. The half-life during oraladministration was confirmed to be significantly longer than the reportedliterature value of 8 min, and the bioavailability of the tablet wasapproximately 25% higher than that of the oral solution.

AB  - As the world desperately searches for ways to treat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a growing number of people are turning to herbal remedies.The Artemisia species, such as A. annua and A. afra, in particular, exhibitpositive effects against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19 related symptoms. A. annua is a source ofartemisinin, which is active against malaria, and also exhibits potential forother diseases. This has increased interest in artemisinin's potential for drugrepurposing. Artemisinin-based combination therapies, so-called ACTs, havealready been recognized as first-line treatments against malaria. Artemisiaextract, as well as ACTs, have demonstrated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Artemisininand its derivatives have also shown anti-inflammatory effects, includinginhibition of interleukin-6 (IL-6) that plays a key role in the development ofsevere COVID-19. There is now sufficient evidence in the literature to suggestthe effectiveness of Artemisia, its constituents and/or artemisinin derivatives, to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 infection by inhibiting its invasion, andreplication, as well as reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, andmitigating lung damage.

AB  - The severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the pace of its global spread havemotivated researchers to opt for repurposing existing drugs against SARS-CoV-2rather than discover or develop novel ones. For reasons of speed, throughput, andcost-effectiveness, virtual screening campaigns, relying heavily on in silicodocking, have dominated published reports. A particular focus as a drug targethas been the principal active site (i.e., RNA synthesis) of RNA-dependent RNApolymerase (RdRp), despite the existence of a second, and also indispensable,active site in the same enzyme. Here we report the results of our experimentalinterrogation of several small-molecule inhibitors, including natural productsproposed to be effective by in silico studies. Notably, we find that twoantibiotics in clinical use, fidaxomicin and rifabutin, inhibit RNA synthesis by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in vitro and inhibit viral replication in cell culture. However, our mutagenesis studies contradict the binding sites predicted computationally.We discuss the implications of these and other findings for computational studiespredicting the binding of ligands to large and flexible protein complexes andtherefore for drug discovery or repurposing efforts utilizing such studies.Finally, we suggest several improvements on such efforts ongoing againstSARS-CoV-2 and future pathogens as they arise.

AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) wreaked havoc all over the world.Although vaccines for the disease have recently become available and started tobe administered to the population in various countries, there is still a strongand urgent need for treatments to cure COVID-19. One of the safest and fasteststrategies is represented by drug repurposing (DRPx). In this study, thirtycompounds with known safety profiles were identified from a chemical library ofPhase II-and-up compounds through a combination of SOM Biotech's ArtificialIntelligence (AI) technology, SOM(AI)PRO, and in silico docking calculations withthird-party software. The selected compounds were then tested in vitro forinhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro or Mpro). Of thethirty compounds, three (cynarine, eravacycline, and prexasertib) displayedstrong inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. VeroE6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 were used to find the cell protection capability of each candidate.Among the three compounds, only eravacycline showed potential antiviralactivities with no significant cytotoxicity. A further study is planned forpre-clinical trials.

AB  - The drug repurposing of known approved drugs (e.g., lopinavir/ritonavir) hasfailed to treat SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Therefore, it is important togenerate new chemical entities against this virus. As a critical enzyme in thelifecycle of the coronavirus, the 3C-like main protease (3CLpro or Mpro) is themost attractive target for antiviral drug design. Based on a recently solvedstructure (PDB ID: 6LU7), we developed a novel advanced deep Q-learning networkwith a fragment-based drug design (ADQN-FBDD) for generating potential leadcompounds targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. We obtained a series of derivatives fromthe lead compounds based on our structure-based optimization policy (SBOP). Allof the 47 lead compounds obtained directly with our AI model and relatedderivatives based on the SBOP are accessible in our molecular library. Thesecompounds can be used as potential candidates by researchers to develop drugsagainst SARS-CoV-2.

LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10061342 [doi]
AB  - During an emergency, such as a pandemic in which time and resources are extremelyscarce, it is important to find effective and rapid solutions when searching for possible treatments. One possibility in this regard is the repurposing ofavailable "on the market" drugs. This is a proof of the concept study showing thepotential of a collaboration between two research groups, engaged incomputer-aided drug design and control of viral infections, for the developmentof early strategies to combat future pandemics. We describe a QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) based repurposing study on molecular topologyand molecular docking for identifying inhibitors of the main protease (Mpro) ofSARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. The aim of this computationalstrategy was to create an agile, rapid, and efficient way to enable the selectionof molecules capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 protease. Molecules selectedthrough in silico method were tested in vitro using human coronavirus 229E as asurrogate for SARS-CoV-2. Three strategies were used to screen the antiviralactivity of these molecules against human coronavirus 229E in cell cultures,e.g., pre-treatment, co-treatment, and post-treatment. We found &gt;99% of virus inhibition during pre-treatment and co-treatment and 90-99% inhibition when themolecules were applied post-treatment (after infection with the virus). From all tested compounds, Molport-046-067-769 and Molport-046-568-802 are here reportedfor the first time as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds.

LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11060806 [doi]
AB  - Although chemotherapeutic treatment regimens are currently available, andconsiderable effort has been lavished on the development of new drugs for thetreatment of tuberculosis (TB), the disease remains deeply intractable andwidespread. This is due not only to the nature of the life cycle andextraordinarily disseminated habitat of the causative pathogen, principallyMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), in humans and the multi-drug resistance of Mtb to current drugs, but especially also to the difficulty of enabling universaltreatment of individuals, immunocompromised or otherwise, in widely differingsocio-economic environments. For the purpose of globally eliminating TB by 2035, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the "End-TB" initiative byemploying interventions focusing on high impact, integrated and patient-centered approaches, such as individualized therapy. However, the extraordinary shortfall in stipulated aims, for example in actual treatment and in TB preventativetreatments during the period 2018-2022, latterly and greatly exacerbated by theCOVID-19 pandemic, means that even greater pressure is now placed on enhancingour scientific understanding of the disease, repurposing or repositioning olddrugs and developing new drugs as well as evolving innovative treatment methods. In the specific context of multidrug resistant Mtb, it is furthermore noted that the incidence of extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB) has significantly increased. Thisreview focusses on the potential of utilizing self-double-emulsifying drugdelivery systems (SDEDDSs) as topical drug delivery systems for the dermal route of administration to aid in treatment of cutaneous TB (CTB) and othermycobacterial infections as a prelude to evaluating related systems for moreeffective treatment of CTB and other mycobacterial infections at large. As astarting point, we consider here the possibility of adapting the highlylipophilic riminophenazine clofazimine, with its potential for treatment ofmulti-drug resistant TB, for this purpose. Additionally, recently reportedsynergism achieved by adding clofazimine to first-line TB regimens signifies the need to consider clofazimine. Thus, the biological effects and pharmacology ofclofazimine are reviewed. The potential of plant-based oils acting asemulsifiers, skin penetration enhancers as well as these materials behaving asanti-microbial components for transporting the incorporated drug are alsodiscussed.

TI  - In silico drug repurposing for coronavirus (COVID-19): screening known HCV drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bound to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) (6M0J).
LID - 10.1007/s11030-022-10469-7 [doi]
AB  - In this study, FDA-approved HCV antiviral drugs and their structuralanalogues-several of them in clinical trials-were tested for their inhibitoryproperties toward the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bound to angiotensin-convertingenzyme 2 (6M0J) using a virtual screening approach and computational chemistrymethods. The most stable structures and the corresponding binding affinities ofthirteen such antiviral compounds were obtained. Frontier molecular orbitaltheory, global reactivity descriptors, molecular docking calculations andelectrostatic potential analysis were used to hypothesize the bioactivity ofthese drugs against 6M0J. It is found that an increased affinity for the protein is shown by inhibitors with large compound volume, relatively higherelectrophilicity index, aromatic rings and heteroatoms that participate inhydrogen bonding. Among the tested drugs, four compounds 10-13 showed excellentresults-binding affinities - 11.2 to - 11.5 kcal mol(-1). These four top scoring compounds may act as lead compounds for further experimental validation, clinicaltrials and even for the development of more potent antiviral agents against theSARS-CoV-2. Approved HCV drugs and analogues were tested for their bioactivitytowards the SARS-CoV-2 (6M0J) using virtual screening, ESP and MD analysis.

AB  - Non-Structural Protein 6 (NSP6) has a protecting role for SARS-CoV-2 replication by inhibiting the expansion of autophagosomes inside the cell. NSP6 is involvedin the endoplasmic reticulum stress response by binding to Sigma receptor 1(SR1). Nevertheless, NSP6 crystal structure is not solved yet. Therefore, NSP6 isconsidered a challenging target in Structure-Based Drug Discovery. Herein, weutilized the high quality NSP6 model built by AlphaFold in our study. Targeting aputative NSP6 binding site is believed to inhibit the SR1-NSP6 protein-proteininteractions. Three databases were virtually screened, namely FDA-approved drugs (DrugBank), Northern African Natural Products Database (NANPDB) and South AfricanNatural Compounds Database (SANCDB) with a total of 8158 compounds. Furthervalidation for 9 candidates via molecular dynamics simulations for 100 nsrecommended potential binders to the NSP6 binding site. The proposed candidatesare recommended for biological testing to cease the rapidly growing pandemic.

TI  - Drugs and convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19: a survey of theinterventional clinical studies in Italy after 1 year of pandemic.
PG  - 527
LID - 10.1186/s13063-022-06474-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic hashighlighted the importance of health research and fostered clinical research asnever before. A huge number of clinical trials for potential COVID-19interventions have been launched worldwide. Therefore, the effort of monitoringand characterizing the ongoing research portfolio of COVID-19 clinical trials hasbecome crucial in order to fill evidence gaps that can arise, define researchpriorities and methodological issues, and eventually, formulate valuablerecommendations for investigators and sponsors. The main purpose of the presentwork was to analyze the landscape of COVID-19 clinical research in Italy, bymapping and describing the characteristics of planned clinical trialsinvestigating the role of drugs and convalescent plasma for treatment orprevention of COVID-19 disease. METHODS: During an 11-month period between May2020 and April 2021, we performed a survey of the Italian COVID-19 clinicaltrials on therapeutic and prophylactic drugs and convalescent plasma. Clinicaltrials registered in the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) and ClinicalTrials.govwebsites were regularly monitored. In the present paper, we report an analysis ofstudy design characteristics and other trial features at 6 April 2021. RESULTS:Ninety-four clinical trials planned to be carried out in Italy were identified.Almost all of them (91%) had a therapeutic purpose; as for the study design, the majority of them adopted a parallel group (74%) and randomized (76%) design. Few of them were blinded (33%). Eight multiarm studies were identified, and two ofthem were multinational platform trials. Many therapeutic strategies wereinvestigated, mostly following a drug repositioning therapeutic approach.CONCLUSIONS: Our study describes the characteristics of COVID-19 clinical trials planned to be carried out in Italy over about 1 year of pandemic emergency. High level quality clinical trials were identified, although some weaknesses in study design and replications of experimental interventions were observed, particularlyin the early phase of the pandemic. Our findings provide a critical view of theclinical research strategies adopted for COVID-19 in Italy during the early phaseof the pandemic. Further actions could include monitoring and follow-up of trial results and publications and focus on non-pharmacological research areas.

TI  - Modulating Fingolimod (FTY720) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Activity Using a PLGA-Based DrugDelivery System.
PG  - 3371-3383
LID - 10.1021/acsabm.2c00349 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 has resulted in more than 490 million people being infected worldwide,with over 6 million deaths by April 05th, 2022. Even though the development ofsafe vaccine options is an important step to reduce viral transmission anddisease progression, COVID-19 cases will continue to occur, and for those cases, efficient treatment remains to be developed. Here, a drug repurposing strategyusing nanotechnology is explored to develop a therapy for COVID-19 treatment.Nanoparticles (NPs) based on PLGA for fingolimod (FTY720) encapsulation show asize of approximately 150 nm and high drug entrapment ( approximately 90%). TheNP (NP@FTY720) can control FTY720 release in a pH-dependent manner. Cytotoxicity assays using different cell lines show that NP@FTY720 displays less toxicity thanthe free drug. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy reveal that NPs areactively internalized mostly through caveolin-mediated endocytosis andmacropinocytosis pathways and co-localized with lysosomes. Finally, NP@FTY720 notonly exhibits anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity at non-cytotoxic concentrations, but itsbiological potential for viral infection inhibition is nearly 70 times higherthan that of free drug treatment. Based on these findings, the combination ofdrug repurposing and nanotechnology as NP@FTY720 is presented for the first time and represents a promising frontline in the fight against COVID-19.

LID - 10.31083/j.fbs1402012 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has provided an opportunity for repurposing of drugs,including complex, natural drugs, to meet the global need for safe and effective antiviral medicines which do not promote multidrug resistance nor inflate medicalcosts. The author herein describes his own repurposing of herbal tinctures,previously prepared for oncology, into a possibly synergistic, anti-COVID 41"herb" formula of extracts derived from 36 different plants and medicinalmushrooms. A method of multi-sample in vitro testing in green monkey kidney vero cells is proposed for testing the Hypothesis that even in such a largecombination, antiviral potency may be preserved, along with therapeutic synergy, smoothness, and complexity. The possibility that the formula's potency mayimprove with age is considered, along with a suitable method for testing it.Collaborative research inquiries are welcome.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causativeagent of the contagious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which was firstidentified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Around the world, many researchers focused their research on identifying inhibitors against the druggable SARS-CoV-2targets. The reported genomic mutations have a direct effect on thereceptor-binding domain (RBD), which interacts with host angiotensin-convertingenzyme 2 (ACE-2) for viral cell entry. These mutations, some of which arevariants of concern (VOC), lead to increased morbidity and mortality rates. Thenewest variants including B.1.617.2 (Delta), AY.1 (Delta plus), and C.37 (Lambda)were considered in this study. Thus, an exhaustive structure-based virtualscreening of a ligand library (in which FDA approved drugs are also present)using the drug-likeness screening, molecular docking, ADMET profiling wasperformed followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and MolecularMechanics-Poisson Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) calculation to identifycompounds or drugs can be repurposed for inhibiting the wild type, Delta, Deltaplus and Lambda variants of RBD of the spike protein. Based on the virtualscreening steps, two FDA approved drugs, Atovaquone (atv) and Praziquantel (prz),were selected and repurposed as the best candidates of SARS-CoV-2 RBD inhibitors.Molecular docking results display that both atv and prz contribute in differentinteraction with binding site residues (Gln493, Asn501 and Gly502 in the hydrogenbond formation, Phe490 and Tyr505 in the pi- pi stacking and Tyr449, Ser494, and Phe497 in the vdW interactions) in the wild type, Delta, Delta plus and Lambdavariants of RBD of the spike protein. MD simulations revealed that among theeight studied complexes, the wild type-atv and Delta-prz complexes have the most structural stability over the simulation time. Furthermore, MM-PBSA calculationshowed that in the atv containing complexes, highest binding affinity is related to the wild type-atv complex and in the prz containing complexes, it is relatedto the Delta-prz complex. The validation of docking results was done by comparingwith experimental data (heparin in complex with wild type and Delta variants).Also, comparison of the obtained results with the result of simulation of the k22with the studied proteins showed that atv and prz are suitable inhibitors forthese proteins, especially wild type t and Delta variant, respectively. Thus, we found that atv and prz are the best candidate for inhibition of wild type andDelta variant of the spike protein. Also, atv can be an appropriate inhibitor forthe Lambda variant. Obtained in silico results may help the development of newanti-COVID-19 drugs.

AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak has been devastating, with hundreds of millions ofinfections and millions of deaths reported worldwide. In response, theapplication of structure-activity relationships (SAR) upon experimentallyvalidated inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) may provide an avenuefor the identification of new lead compounds active against COVID-19. Upon thebasis of information gleaned from a combination of reported crystal structuresand the docking of experimentally validated inhibitors, four "rules" fordesigning potent M(pro) inhibitors have been proposed. The aim here is to guidemedicinal chemists toward the most probable hits and to provide guidance onrepurposing available structures as M(pro) inhibitors. Experimental examinationof our own previously reported inhibitors using the four "rules" identified apotential lead compound, the cathepsin inhibitor GB111-NH2, that was 2.3 timesmore potent than SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) inhibitor N3.

TI  - When Virtual Screening Yields Inactive Drugs: Dealing with False TheoreticalFriends.
PG  - e202200278
LID - 10.1002/cmdc.202200278 [doi]
AB  - The search of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 in available libraries of compoundswas initiated as soon as WHO announced that the coronavirus outbreak became apandemic. That pivotal task has been conducted by both experimental groups inwet-labs as well as by theoretical chemists in supercomputing centers. Thecombination of biochemical and clinical intuitions yields first to remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral that remains as the standard solution for the treatment of severe cases, while paxlovid, molnupiravir and fluvoxamine have been recently proposed as oral alternatives. Unfortunately, the intensive publication ofstandard virtual screening (VS) simulations might be not the best strategy toincrease that short list of antivirals. This contribution joins theory andbiological assays to rescore massive VS. Our goal is to critically assess prosand cons of using molecular models for drug repurposing.

AB  - COVID-19 pathogenesis is mainly attributed to dysregulated antiviral immuneresponse, the prominent hallmark of COVID-19. As no established drugs areavailable against SARS-CoV-2 and developing new ones would be a big challenge,repurposing of existing drugs holds promise against COVID-19. Here, we used asignature-based strategy to delve into cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 infectionin order to identify potential host contributors in COVID-19 pathogenesis and to find repurposable drugs using in silico approaches. We scrutinized transcriptomicprofile of various human alveolar cell sources infected with SARS-CoV-2 todetermine up-regulated genes specific to COVID-19. Enrichment analysis revealedthat the up-regulated genes were involved mainly in viral infectious disease,immune system, and signal transduction pathways. Analysis of protein-proteininteraction network and COVID-19 molecular pathway resulted in identifyingseveral anti-viral proteins as well as 11 host pro-viral proteins, ADAR, HBEGF,MMP9, USP18, JUN, FOS, IRF2, ICAM1, IFI35, CASP1, and STAT3. Finally, moleculardocking of up-regulated proteins and all FDA-approved drugs revealed that bothHydrocortisone and Benzhydrocodone possess high binding affinity for allpro-viral proteins. The suggested repurposed drugs should be subject tocomplementary in vitro and in vivo experiments in order to be evaluated in detailprior to clinical studies in potential management of COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has claimed millions of lives and devastated thehealth service system, livelihood, and economy in many countries worldwide.Despite the vaccination programs in many countries, the spread of the pandemiccontinues, and effective treatment is still urgently needed. Although someantiviral drugs have been shown to be effective, they are not widely available.Repurposing of anti-parasitic drugs with in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity is apromising approach being tested in many clinical trials. Combination of thesedrugs is a plausible way to enhance their effectiveness. METHODS: The in vitroanti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of combinations of niclosamide, ivermectin andchloroquine were evaluated in Vero E6 and lung epithelial cells, Calu-3. RESULTS:All the two-drug combinations showed higher potency resulting in up to 4-foldreduction in the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values compared to individual drugs. Among these combinations, niclosamide-ivermectin achieved thehighest inhibitory level of over 99%. Combination synergy analysis showedniclosamide-ivermectin combination to have the best synergy score with a meanLoewe synergy score of 4.28 and a peak synergy score of 24.6 in Vero E6 cells anda mean Loewe synergy score of 3.82 and a peak synergy score of 10.86 in Calu-3cells. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated the benefit of drugcombinations on anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Niclosamide and ivermectin showed thebest synergistic profile and should be further tested in clinical trials.

AB  - Fungal infections in humans are responsible for mild to severe infectionsresulting in systemic effects that cause a large amount of mortality. Invasivefungal infections are having similar symptomatic effects to those of COVID-19.The COVID-19 patients are immunocompromised in nature and have a high probabilityof developing severe fungal infections, resulting in the development of furthercomplications. The existing antifungal therapy has associated problems related tothe development of drug resistance, being sub-potent in nature, and the presence of undesirable toxic effects. The fungal dihydrofolate reductase is an essential enzyme involved in the absorption of dietary folic acid and its conversion intotetrahydrofolate, which is a coenzyme required for the biosynthesis of the fungalnucleotides. Thus, in the current study, an attempt has been made to identifypotential folate inhibitors of Candida albicans by a computational drugrepurposing approach. Based upon the molecular docking simulation-based virtualscreening followed by the molecular dynamic simulation of the macromolecularcomplex, benzbromarone has been identified as a potential anti-folate agent forthe development of a novel therapy for the treatment of candidiasis.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) has spread on an unprecedented scale around the globe. Despite of 141,975 published papers on COVID-19 and several hundreds of newstudies carried out every day, this pandemic remains as a global challenge.Biomedical literature mining helps the researchers to understand the etiology of the disease and to gain an in-depth knowledge of the disease, potential drugs,vaccines developed and novel therapies. In addition to the available treatments, there is a huge need to address the comorbidity-based disease mortality in caseof COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), hypertension andcardiovascular disease (CVD). In this chapter, we provide a hybrid protocol basedon biomedical literature mining, network analysis of omics data, and deeplearning for the identification of most potential drugs for COVID-19.

TI  - Cysteamine exerts in vitro antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV-2 Delta andOmicron variants.
PG  - 288
LID - 10.1038/s41420-022-01080-8 [doi]
AB  - The novel SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) represent a considerable globalalarm because their mutations are known to affect transmissibility and causeimmune escape. While preventing severe disease and deaths, the available vaccinesdo not avoid infection; therefore, COVID-19 disease management still requireseffective therapies. We have recently reported that the aminothiol cysteamine, a drug already applied to humans, exerts direct antiviral activity againstSARS-CoV-2 and has in vitro immunomodulatory effect. To evaluate whether thiscompound exerts antiviral effects also against SARS-CoV-2 variants, we performed different infected cell-based assays using Wild type, Delta, or Omicron VOC. Wefound that cysteamine significantly reduces the cytopathic effect induced bySARS-CoV-2 Wild type strain and Delta variant in Vero E6 cells. On the otherhand, cysteamine had no effects on the survival of cells infected with theOmicron variant, due to the lack of cytotoxicity on Vero E6 cells, at least when infected at MOI = 0.001 for 72 h. Moreover, cysteamine significantly reduced the production of Wild type, Delta, and Omicron variants as measured by the virusreleased in the culture media (Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells) and by transmissionelectron microscopy analysis (Vero E6 cells). Notably, cysteamine is moreeffective in inhibiting the Omicron rather than Delta or Wild type viruses, with an 80% inhibition of Omicron production compared to 40% of Wild type and Deltavariant. Overall, our findings demonstrate that cysteamine exerts directantiviral actions against SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants, in addition tothe Wild type virus. Our data further demonstrate that cysteamine is a goodcandidate as repurposing drug for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection for thepresent and, likely, the future VOC and, therefore, it would be important toinvestigate its clinical relevance in randomized clinical trials.

LID - 10.1093/bib/bbac229 [doi]
AB  - The network approach is quickly becoming a fundamental building block ofcomputational methods aiming at elucidating the mechanism of action (MoA) andtherapeutic effect of drugs. By modeling the effect of drugs and diseases ondifferent biological networks, it is possible to better explain the interplaybetween disease perturbations and drug targets as well as how drug compoundsinduce favorable biological responses and/or adverse effects. Omics technologies have been extensively used to generate the data needed to study the mechanisms ofaction of drugs and diseases. These data are often exploited to definecondition-specific networks and to study whether drugs can reverse diseaseperturbations. In this review, we describe network data mining algorithms thatare commonly used to study drug's MoA and to improve our understanding of thebasis of chronic diseases. These methods can support fundamental stages of thedrug development process, including the identification of putative drug targets, the in silico screening of drug compounds and drug combinations for the treatmentof diseases. We also discuss recent studies using biological and omics-drivennetworks to search for possible repurposed FDA-approved drug treatments forSARS-CoV-2 infections (COVID-19).

TI  - Changes in dispensing of medicines proposed for re-purposing in the first year ofthe COVID-19 pandemic in Australia.
PG  - e0269482
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0269482 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since COVID-19 was first recognised, there has been ever-changingevidence and misinformation around effective use of medicines. Understanding how pandemics impact on medicine use can help policymakers act quickly to preventharm. We quantified changes in dispensing of common medicines proposed for"re-purposing" due to their perceived benefits as therapeutic or preventive forCOVID-19 in Australia. METHODS: We performed an interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study using nationwide dispensing claims data (January2017-November 2020). We focused on six subsidized medicines proposed forre-purposing: hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ivermectin, colchicine,corticosteroids, and calcitriol (Vitamin D analog). We quantified changes inmonthly dispensing and initiation trends during COVID-19 (March-November 2020)using autoregressive integrated moving average models and comparedcharacteristics of initiators in 2020 and 2019. RESULTS: In March 2020, weobserved a 99% (95%CI: 96%-103%) increase in hydroxychloroquine dispensing(approximately 22% attributable to new users), and a 199% increase (95%CI:184%-213%) in initiation, with an increase in prescribing by generalpractitioners (42% in 2020 vs 25% in 2019) rather than specialists. Theseincreases subsided following regulatory restrictions on prescribing. There was a small but sustained increase in ivermectin dispensing over multiple months, with an 80% (95%CI 42%-118%) increase in initiation in May 2020 following its firstidentification as potentially disease-modifying in April. Other than increases inMarch related to stockpiling, we observed no change in the initiation ofcalcitriol or colchicine during COVID-19. Dispensing of corticosteroids andazithromycin was lower than expected from April through November 2020.CONCLUSIONS: While most increases in dispensing observed early on during COVID-19were temporary and appear to be related to stockpiling among existing users, weobserved increases in the initiation of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and ashift in prescribing patterns which may be related to the media hype around thesemedicines. A quick response by regulators can help limit inappropriaterepurposing to lessen the impact on medicine supply and patient harm.

PG  - 361
LID - 10.1007/s00018-022-04390-3 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 is a complex disease with short- and long-term respiratory, inflammatoryand neurological symptoms that are triggered by the infection with SARS-CoV-2.Invasion of the brain by SARS-CoV-2 has been observed in humans and is postulatedto be involved in post-COVID state. Brain infection is particularly pronounced inthe K18-hACE2 mouse model of COVID-19. Prevention of brain infection in the acutephase of the disease might thus be of therapeutic relevance to preventlong-lasting symptoms of COVID-19. We previously showed that melatonin or twoprescribed structural analogs, agomelatine and ramelteon delay the onset ofsevere clinical symptoms and improve survival of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2mice. Here, we show that treatment of K18-hACE2 mice with melatonin and twomelatonin-derived marketed drugs, agomelatine and ramelteon, prevents SARS-CoV-2 entry in the brain, thereby reducing virus-induced damage of small cerebralvessels, immune cell infiltration and brain inflammation. Molecular modelinganalyses complemented by experimental studies in cells showed that SARS-CoV-2entry in endothelial cells is prevented by melatonin binding to anallosteric-binding site on human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), thusinterfering with ACE2 function as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Our findings open new perspectives for the repurposing of melatonergic drugs and itsclinically used analogs in the prevention of brain infection by SARS-CoV-2 andCOVID-19-related long-term neurological symptoms.

AB  - The development of specific drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection is a majorchallenge facing global science and healthcare. Despite numerous attempts, there are still no truly effective drugs. Currently, the main approach in the creation of drugs against COVID-19 is repurposing, i.e., re-profiling existing drugsapproved for medical use, for example, the use of a drug for the treatment ofEbola-Remdesivir, and the use of a drug for the treatment ofinfluenza-Favipiravir. However, it is already obvious that these drugs are notspecific enough nor effective enough. Another promising approach is the creation of new molecules, but it should be noted immediately that implementation requiresmuch more time and costs. However, the search for new SARS-CoV-2 specificantiviral agents continues. The aim of our work was the creation of new5-substituted uridine derivatives as potential inhibitors of coronavirusRNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The substances were obtained in high yields by the SuzukiMiyaura reaction and characterized using modern physicochemical methods.However, testing of their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 did not reveal a significant inhibitory effect.

AB  - The worldwide burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is stillunremittingly prevailing, with more than 440 million infections and over 5.9million deaths documented so far since the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic. The non-availability of treatment furtheraggravates the scenario, thereby demanding the exploration of pre-existingFDA-approved drugs for their effectiveness against COVID-19. The current researchaims to identify potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs using a computational approachand repurpose them if possible. In the present study, we have collected a set of 44 FDA-approved drugs of different classes from a previously published literaturewith their potential antiviral activity against COVID-19. We have employed bothregression- and classification-based quantitative structure-activity relationship(QSAR) modeling to identify critical chemical features essential foranticoronaviral activity. Multiple models with the consensus algorithm wereemployed for the regression-based approach to improve the predictions.Additionally, we have employed a machine learning-based read-across approachusing Read-Across-v3.1 available fromhttps://sites.google.com/jadavpuruniversity.in/dtc-lab-software/home and lineardiscriminant analysis for the efficient prediction of potential drug candidatefor COVID-19. Finally, the quantitative prediction ability of different modeling approaches was compared using the sum of ranking differences (SRD). Furthermore, we have predicted a true external set of 98 pharmaceuticals using the developedmodels for their probable anti-COVID activity and their prediction reliabilitywas checked employing the "Prediction Reliability Indicator" tool available from https://dtclab.webs.com/software-tools. Though the present study does not target any protein of viral interaction, the modeling approaches developed can behelpful for identifying or screening potential anti-coronaviral drug candidates.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been on the agenda of humanityfor more than 2 years. In the meantime, the pandemic has caused economicshutdowns, halt of daily lives and global mobility, overcrowding of thehealthcare systems, panic, and worse, more than 6 million deaths. Today, there isstill no specific therapy for COVID-19. Research focuses on repurposing ofantiviral drugs that are licensed or currently in the research phase, with aknown systemic safety profile. However, local safety profile should also beevaluated depending on the new indication, administration route and dosage form. Additionally, various vaccines have been developed. But the causative virus,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has undergonemultiple variations, too. The premise that vaccines may suffice to eradicate new and all variants is unreliable, as they are based on earlier versions of thevirus. Therefore, a specific medication therapy for COVID-19 is crucial andneeded in order to prevent severe complications of the disease. Even though thereis no specific drug that inhibits the replication of the disease-causing virus,among the current treatment options, systemic antivirals are the most medicallyappropriate. As SARS-CoV-2 directly targets the lungs and initiates lung damage, treating COVID-19 with inhalants can offer many advantages over theenteral/parenteral administration. Inhaled drug delivery provides higher drugconcentration, specifically in the pulmonary system. This enables the reductionof systemic side effects and produces a rapid clinical response. In this article,the most frequently (systemically) used antiviral compounds are reviewedincluding Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Molnupiravir, Lopinavir-Ritonavir, Umifenovir,Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine and Heparin. A comprehensive literature searchwas conducted to provide insight into the potential inhaled use of theseantiviral drugs and the current studies on inhalation therapy for COVID-19 waspresented. A brief evaluation was also made on the use of inhaler devices in the treatment of COVID-19. Inhaled antivirals paired with suitable inhaler devicesshould be considered for COVID-19 treatment options.

AB  - Novel drug compound hunting was carried out for SARS-CoV-2 proteins with lowmutation susceptibility. The probability of escape mutation and drug resistanceis lower if conserved microbial proteins are targeted by therapeutic drugs.Mutation rate of all SARS-CoV-2 proteins were analyzed via multiple sequencealignment Non-Structural Protein 13 and Non-Structural Protein 16 were selectedfor the current study due to low mutation rate among viral strains andsignificant functionality. Cross-species mutation rate analysis for NSP13 andNSP16 showed these are well-conserved proteins among four coronaviral species.Viral helicase inhibitors, identified using literature-mining, were dockedagainst NSP13. Pharmacophore-based screening of 11,375 natural compounds wasconducted for NSP16. Stabilities of top compounds inside human body wereconfirmed via molecular dynamic simulation. ADME properties and LD50 values ofthe helicase inhibitors and Ambinter natural compounds were analyzed. Compoundsagainst NSP13 showed binding affinities between -10 and -5.9 kcal/mol wherebyivermectin and scutellarein showed highest binding energies of -10 and -9.9kcal/mol. Docking of 18 hit compounds against NSP16 yielded binding affinitiesbetween -8.9 and -4.1 kcal/mol. Hamamelitannin and deacyltunicamycin were the topcompounds with binding affinities of -8.9 kcal/mol and -8.4 kcal/mol. The topcompounds showed stable ligand-protein interactions in molecular dynamicssimulation. The analyses revealed two hit compounds against each targeted proteindisplaying stable behavior, high binding affinity and molecular interactions.Conversion of these compounds into drugs after in vitro experimentation canbecome better treatment options to elevate COVID management.

AB  - Herein we have selected seventeen anti-lung cancer drugs to screen against Mpro, PLpro and spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2to ascertain the potential therapeuticagent against COVID-19. ADMET profiling were employed to evaluate theirpharmacokinetic properties. Molecular docking studies revealed that Capmatinib(CAP) showed highest binding affinity against the selected proteins ofSARS-CoV-2. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation and the analysis of RMSD, RMSF,and binding energy confirmed the abrupt conformational changes of the proteinsdue to the presence of this drug. These findings provide an opportunity for doingadvanced experimental research to evaluate the potential drug to combat COVID-19.

TI  - Total Controllability Analysis Discovers Explainable Drugs for Covid-19 Therapyand Prevention.
LID - arXiv:2206.02970v1 [pii]
AB  - Network medicine has been pursued for Covid-19 drug repurposing. One suchapproach adopts structural controllability, a theory for controlling a network(the cell). Motivated to protect the cell from viral infections, we extended thistheory to total controllability and introduced a new concept of control hubs.Perturbation to any control hub renders the cell uncontrollable by exogenousstimuli, e.g., viral infections, so control hubs are ideal drug targets. Wedeveloped an efficient algorithm for finding all control hubs and applied it tothe largest homogenous human protein-protein interaction network. Our new method outperforms several popular gene-selection methods, including that based onstructural controllability. The final 65 druggable control hubs are enriched withfunctions of cell proliferation, regulation of apoptosis, and responses tocellular stress and nutrient levels, revealing critical pathways induced bySARS-CoV-2. These druggable control hubs led to drugs in 4 major categories:antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents, drugs on central nerve systems, anddietary supplements and hormones that boost immunity. Their functions alsoprovided deep insights into the therapeutic mechanisms of the drugs for Covid-19 therapy, making the new approach an explainable drug repurposing method. Aremarkable example is Fostamatinib that has been shown to lower mortality,shorten the length of ICU stay, and reduce disease severity of hospitalizedCovid-19 patients. The drug targets 10 control hubs, 9 of which are kinases that play key roles in cell differentiation and programmed death. One such kinase isRIPK1 that directly interacts with viral protein nsp12, the RdRp of the virus.The study produced many control hubs that were not targets of existing drugs but were enriched with proteins on membranes and the NF-$\kappa$B pathway, so areexcellent candidate targets for new drugs.

AB  - Huge vaccination drives are underway around the world for the ongoing COVID-19pandemic. However, the search for antiviral drugs is equally crucial. As new drugdiscovery is a time-consuming process, repurposing of existing drugs ordeveloping drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 will make the process faster.Considering this, 63 approved and developing antimalarial compounds were selectedto screen against main protease (M(pro)) and papain-like protease (PL(pro)) ofSARS-CoV-2 using in silico methods to find out possible new drug candidate(s).Out of 63 compounds, epoxomicin showed the best binding affinity against theM(pro) with CDocker energy of - 57.511 kcal/mol without any toxic effect. Thiscompound was further taken for molecular dynamic simulation study, where theM(pro)-epoxomicin complex was found to be stable with binding free energy -79.315 kcal/mol. The possible inhibitory potential of the selected compound wasdetermined by 3D-QSAR analysis and found to be 0.4447 microM against SARS-CoV-2M(pro). Finally, the structure activity relationship of the compound was analyzedand two fragments responsible for overall good binding affinity of the compoundat the active site of M(pro) were identified. This study suggests a safeantimalarial drug, namely epoxomicin, as a probable inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2M(pro) which needs further validation by in vitro/in vivo studies before clinicaluse.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 is one of the most infectious and deadly coronaviruses, which has gripped the world, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the numerous studiesbeing conducted on this virus, many uncertainties are with the disease. This isexacerbated by the speedy mutations acquired by the viral strain, which enablesthe disease to present itself differently in different people, introducing newfactors of uncertainty. This study aims at the identification of regulatorypathways across two cell lines, namely, the peripheral blood mononuclear cellline (PBMC) and the normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cell line. Both the above-mentioned cell lines were considered because they support viralreplication. Furthermore, the NHBE cell line captures vital changes in the lungs,which are the main organs affected by the COVID-19 patients, and the PBMC cellline is closely linked to the body's immune system. RNA-Seq analysis,differential gene expression and gene set enrichment analysis for pathwayidentification were followed. Pathway analysis throws light upon the varioussystems affected in the body due to the COVID-19. Gene regulatory networksassociated with the significant pathways were also designed. These networks aidin identifying various gene targets, along with their interactions. Studying the functionality of the pathways and the gene interactions associated with them,aided by long COVID studies, will provide immense clarity about the currentCOVID-19 scenario. In the long term, this will help in the design of therapeutic approaches against the SARS-CoV-2 and can also contribute to drug repurposingstudies. Ultimately, this study identifies and analyses the relationship ofvarious undiscovered or lesser explored pathways in the human body to theSARS-CoV-2 and establish a clearer picture of the association to help streamline further studies and approaches.

AB  - The current Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has shown us that thepharmaceutical research community can organize and administer large nonprofitclinical trials (RECOVERY and SOLIDARITY) and achieve the swift development ofcommon, unpatentable drugs for a new indication: in this case an old, inexpensivedrug, dexamethasone, for COVID-19. Why is it that such nonprofit efforts are sorare and are not organized as a systemic, routine part of drug development in thepublic interest? Based on my own experience with repurposing the alcohol-abusedrug disulfiram (Antabuse) for cancer, I identify at least four serious deadlocksto development of nonprofit drugs. All of these obstacles should be addressed to leverage the potential of the COVID-19 pandemic for better future healthcaresystems in all countries around the world.

AB  - Drug repurposing has broad importance in planetary health for therapeuticsinnovation in infectious diseases as well as common or rare chronic humandiseases. Drug repurposing has also proved important to develop interventionsagainst the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose a new approach for drug repurposinginvolving two-stage prediction and machine learning. First, diseases areclustered by gene expression on the premise that similar patterns of altered geneexpression imply critical pathways shared in different disease conditions. Next, drug efficacy is assessed by the reversibility of abnormal gene expression, andresults are clustered to identify repurposing targets. To cluster similardiseases, gene expression data from 262 cases of 31 diseases and 268 controlswere analyzed by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for DimensionReduction followed by k-means to optimize the number of clusters. For evaluation,we examined disease-specific gene expression data for inclusion, body myositis,polymyositis, and dermatomyositis (DM), and used LINCS L1000 characteristicdirection signatures search engine (L1000CDS(2)) to obtain lists ofsmall-molecule compounds that reversed the expression patterns of thesespecifically altered genes as candidates for drug repurposing. Finally, thefunctions of affected genes were analyzed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis toexamine consistency with expected drug efficacy. Consequently, we founddisease-specific gene expression, and importantly, identified 20 drugs such asBMS-387032, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, mitoxantrone, alvocidib, andvorinostat as candidates for repurposing. These were previously noted to beeffective against two of the three diseases, and have a high probability of beingeffective against the other. That is, inclusion body myositis and DM. Thetwo-stage prediction approach to drug repurposing presented here offersinnovation to inform future drug discovery and clinical trials in a variety ofhuman diseases.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused aworldwide pandemic with unprecedented economic and societal impact. Currently,several vaccines are available and multitudes of antiviral treatments have beenproposed and tested. Although many of the vaccines show clinical efficacy, theyare not equally accessible worldwide. Additionally, due to the continuousemergence of new variants and generally short duration of immunity, thedevelopment of effective antiviral treatments remains of the utmost importance.Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, substantial efforts have been undertaken torepurpose existing drugs for accelerated clinical testing and emergency useauthorizations. However, drug-repurposing studies using cellular assays oftenidentify hits that later prove ineffective clinically, highlighting the need for more complex screening models. To this end, we evaluated the activity of singlecompounds that have either been tested clinically or already undergone extensive preclinical profiling, using a standardized in vitro model of human nasalepithelium. Furthermore, we also evaluated drug combinations based on asub-maximal concentration of molnupiravir. We report the antiviral activity of 95single compounds and 30 combinations. We show that only a few single agents arehighly effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication while selected drugcombinations containing 10 microM molnupiravir boosted antiviral activitycompared to single compound treatment. These data indicate thatmolnupiravir-based combinations are worthy of further consideration as potential treatment strategies against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

AB  - The recent pandemic, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has devastated humanity and iscontinuing to threaten us. Due to the high transmissibility of this pathogen,researchers are still trying to cope with the treatment and prevention of thisdisease. Few of them were successful in finding cure for COVID-19 by includingrepurposed drugs in the treatment. In such pandemic situations, when it is nearlyimpossible to design and implement a new drug target, previously designedantiviral drugs could help against novel viruses, referred to as drugrepurposing/redirecting/repositioning or re-profiling. This review describes the current landscape of the repurposing of antiviral drugs for COVID-19 and theimpact of these drugs on our nervous system. In some cases, specific antiviraltherapy has been notably associated with neurological toxicity, characterized by peripheral neuropathy, neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric effects within thecentral nervous system (CNS).

AB  - Chlorpheniramine Maleate (CPM), also known as chlorphenamine, is a potentalkylamine first-generation H1 antihistamine that has been around since the1950s. CPM is a widely popular drug commonly used to treat allergic conditions,given its antihistamine properties. Although mainly used in over-the-countertreatment for cough and colds, various studies discuss a wide range of CPM'sclinical uses, such as treating asthma, plasma cell gingivitis, chronicurticaria, depression, among others. This antihistamine is usually taken orally; however, intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous routes have beendocumented. Intranasal routes have recently been explored, especially due to its antiviral properties against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2). Accordingly, given CPM's extensive medical and safety profile, the present review explores this versatile drug's current and potential clinicalapplications. Although it is widely used mainly for treating common colds andaforementioned allergic conditions, it can be concluded that CPM can beconsidered to be used for other clinical indications. The repurposing of CPM for other clinical indications such as COVID-19 needs to be further explored through more extensive studies.

TI  - Suite of TMPRSS2 Assays for Screening Drug Repurposing Candidates as PotentialTreatments of COVID-19.
PG  - 1191-1203
LID - 10.1021/acsinfecdis.2c00172 [doi]
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is the causative viral pathogen driving the COVID-19 pandemic thatprompted an immediate global response to the development of vaccines andantiviral therapeutics. For antiviral therapeutics, drug repurposing allows forrapid movement of the existing clinical candidates and therapies into humanclinical trials to be tested as COVID-19 therapies. One effective antiviraltreatment strategy used early in symptom onset is to prevent viral entry.SARS-CoV-2 enters ACE2-expressing cells when the receptor-binding domain of thespike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 followed by cleavage at two cut sites by TMPRSS2. Therefore, a molecule capable of inhibiting theprotease activity of TMPRSS2 could be a valuable antiviral therapy. Initially, weused a fluorogenic high-throughput screening assay for the biochemical screening of 6030 compounds in NCATS annotated libraries. Then, we developed an orthogonal biochemical assay that uses mass spectrometry detection of product formation toensure that hits from the primary screen are not assay artifacts from thefluorescent detection of product formation. Finally, we assessed the hits fromthe biochemical screening in a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped particle entryassay. Of the six molecules advanced for further studies, two are approved drugs in Japan (camostat and nafamostat), two have entered clinical trials (PCI-27483and otamixaban), while the other two molecules are peptidomimetic inhibitors ofTMPRSS2 taken from the literature that have not advanced into clinical trials(compounds 92 and 114). This work demonstrates a suite of assays for thediscovery and development of new inhibitors of TMPRSS2.

AB  - Amid the COVID-19 crisis, we put sizeable efforts to collect a high number ofexperimentally validated drug-virus association entries from literature by textmining and built a human drug-virus association database. To the best of ourknowledge, it is the largest publicly available drug-virus database so far. Next,we develop a novel weight regularization matrix factorization approach, termedWRMF, for in silico drug repurposing by integrating three networks: the knowndrug-virus association network, the drug-drug chemical structure similaritynetwork, and the virus-virus genomic sequencing similarity network. Specifically,WRMF adds a weight to each training sample for reducing the influence of negativesamples (i.e. the drug-virus association is unassociated). A comparison on thecurated drug-virus database shows that WRMF performs better than a fewstate-of-the-art methods. In addition, we selected the other two different publicdatasets (i.e. Cdataset and HMDD V2.0) to assess WRMF's performance. The casestudy also demonstrated the accuracy and reliability of WRMF to infer potentialdrugs for the novel virus. In summary, we offer a useful tool including a noveldrug-virus association database and a powerful method WRMF to repurpose potentialdrugs for new viruses.

AB  - The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) hascontinuously evolved, resulting in the emergence of several variants of concern(VOCs). To study mechanisms of viral entry and potentially identify specificinhibitors, we pseudotyped lentiviral vectors with different SARS-CoV-2 VOC spikevariants (D614G, Alpha, Beta, Delta, Omicron/BA.1), responsible for receptorbinding and membrane fusion. These SARS-CoV-2 lentiviral pseudoviruses wereapplied to screen 774 FDA-approved drugs. For the assay we decided to use CaCo2cells, since they equally allow cell entry through both the direct membranefusion pathway mediated by TMPRSS2 and the endocytosis pathway mediated bycathepsin-L. The active molecules which showed stronger differences in theirpotency to inhibit certain SARS-CoV-2 VOCs included antagonists of G-proteincoupled receptors, like phenothiazine-derived antipsychotic compounds such asChlorpromazine, with highest activity against the Omicron pseudovirus. Ingeneral, our data showed that the various VOCs differ in their preferences forcell entry, and we were able to identify synergistic combinations of inhibitors. Notably, Omicron singled out by relying primarily on the endocytosis pathwaywhile Delta preferred cell entry via membrane fusion. In conclusion, our dataprovide new insights into different entry preferences of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, whichmight help to identify new drug targets.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains prevalent worldwide since its onsetwas confirmed in Wuhan, China in 2019. Vaccines against the causative virus,severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have shown apreventive effect against the onset and severity of COVID-19, and social andeconomic activities are gradually recovering. However, the presence ofvaccine-resistant variants has been reported, and the development of therapeutic agents for patients with severe COVID-19 and related sequelae remains urgent.Drug repurposing, also called drug repositioning or eco-pharma, is the strategyof using previously approved and safe drugs for a therapeutic indication that is different from their original indication. The risk of severe COVID-19 andmortality increases with advancing age, cardiovascular disease, hypertension,diabetes, and cancer. We have reported three protein-protein interactions thatare related to heart failure, and recently identified that one mechanismincreases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mammalian cells. This reviewoutlines the global efforts and outcomes of drug repurposing research for thetreatment of severe COVID-19. It also discusses our recent finding of a newprotein-protein interaction that is common to COVID-19 aggravation and heartfailure.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is the foremost culprit of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (nCoV-19and/or simply COVID-19) and poses a threat to the continued life of humans on theplanet and create pandemic issue globally. The 3-chymotrypsin-like protease(M(PRO) or 3CL(PRO)) is the crucial protease enzyme of SARS-CoV-2, which directlyinvolves the processing and release of translated non-structural proteins (nsps),and therefore involves the development of virus pathogenesis along with outbreak the forecasting of COVID-19 symptoms. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infections can beinhibited by plant-derived chemicals like amentoflavone derivatives, which could be used to develop an anti-COVID-19 drug. Our research study is designed toconduct an in silico analysis on derivatives of amentoflavone (isoginkgetin,putraflavone, 4''''''-methylamentoflavone, bilobetin, ginkgetin, sotetsuflavone, sequoiaflavone, heveaflavone, kayaflavone, and sciadopitysin) for targeting thenon-structural protein of SARS-CoV-2, and subsequently further validate toconfirm their antiviral ability. To conduct all the in silico experiments withthe derivatives of amentoflavone against the M(PRO) protein, both computerizedtools and online servers were applied; notably the software used is UCSF Chimera (version 1.14), PyRx, PyMoL, BIOVIA Discovery Studio tool (version 4.5), YASARA(dynamics simulator), and Cytoscape. Besides, as part of the online tools, theSwissDME and pKCSM were employed. The research study was proposed to implementmolecular docking investigations utilizing compounds that were found to beeffective against the viral primary protease (M(PRO)). M(PRO) protein interacted strongly with 10 amentoflavone derivatives. Every time, amentoflavone compoundsoutperformed the FDA-approved antiviral medicine that is currently underused inCOVID-19 in terms of binding affinity (- 8.9, - 9.4, - 9.7, - 9.1, - 9.3, - 9.0, - 9.7, - 9.3, - 8.8, and - 9.0 kcal/mol, respectively). The best-selectedderivatives of amentoflavone also possessed potential results in 100 ns moleculardynamic simulation (MDS) validation. It is conceivable that based on our insilico research these selected amentoflavone derivatives more precisely4''''''-methylamentoflavone, ginkgetin, and sequoiaflavone have potential forserving as promising lead drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In consequence, it is recommended that additional in vitro as well as in vivo research studies have to be conducted to support the conclusions of this current research study.

AB  - Post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis (PCPF) is a long-term complication that appears in some COVID-19 survivors. However, there are currently limited options fortreating PCPF patients. To address this problem, we investigated COVID-19patients' transcriptome at single-cell resolution and combined biological networkanalyses to repurpose the drugs treating PCPF. We revealed a novel gene signatureof PCPF. The signature is functionally associated with the viral infection andlung fibrosis. Further, the signature has good performance in diagnosing andassessing pulmonary fibrosis. Next, we applied a network-based drug repurposingmethod to explore novel treatments for PCPF. By quantifying the proximity betweenthe drug targets and the signature in the interactome, we identified severalpotential candidates and provided a drug list ranked by their proximity. Takentogether, we revealed a novel gene expression signature as a theragnosticbiomarker for PCPF by integrating different computational approaches. Moreover,we showed that network-based proximity could be used as a framework to repurpose drugs for PCPF.

TI  - Methylene Blue Is a Nonspecific Protein-Protein Interaction Inhibitor withPotential for Repurposing as an Antiviral for COVID-19.
LID - 621 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph15050621 [doi]
AB  - We have previously identified methylene blue, a tricyclic phenothiazine dyeapproved for clinical use for the treatment of methemoglobinemia and for othermedical applications as a small-molecule inhibitor of the protein-proteininteraction (PPI) between the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus andACE2, the first critical step of the attachment and entry of this coronavirusresponsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we show that methylene blueconcentration dependently inhibits this PPI for the spike protein of the originalstrain as well as for those of variants of concern such as the D614G mutant anddelta (B.1.617.2) with IC50 in the low micromolar range (1-5 muM). Methylene bluealso showed promiscuous activity and inhibited several other PPIs of viralproteins (e.g., HCoV-NL63-ACE2, hepatitis C virus E-CD81) as well as others(e.g., IL-2-IL-2Ralpha) with similar potency. This nonspecificitynotwithstanding, methylene blue inhibited the entry of pseudoviruses bearing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2-expressing host cells, both for the originalstrain and the delta variant. It also blocked SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.5) virusreplication in Vero E6 cells with an IC50 in the low micromolar range (1.7 muM)when assayed using quantitative PCR of the viral RNA. Thus, while it seems to be a promiscuous PPI inhibitor with low micromolar activity and has a relativelynarrow therapeutic index, methylene blue inhibits entry and replication ofSARS-CoV-2, including several of its mutant variants, and has potential as apossible inexpensive, broad-spectrum, orally bioactive small-molecule antiviralfor the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

TI  - Design, Synthesis and Evaluation of Fused Bicyclo[2.2.2]octene as a PotentialCore Scaffold for the Non-Covalent Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) MainProtease.
LID - 539 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph15050539 [doi]
AB  - The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic,requires the rapid development of novel antiviral drugs that would contribute to an effective treatment alongside vaccines. Drug repurposing and development ofnew molecules targeting numerous viral targets have already led to promising drugcandidates. To this end, versatile molecular scaffolds with highfunctionalization capabilities play a key role. Starting with the clinically usedconformationally flexible HIV-1 protease inhibitors that inhibit replication ofSARS-CoV-2 and bind major protease 3CL(pro), we designed and synthesized a seriesof rigid bicyclo[2.2.2]octenes fused to N-substituted succinimides to testwhether this core scaffold could support the development of non-covalent 3CL(pro)inhibitors. Inhibition assays confirmed that some compounds can inhibit theSARS-CoV-2 main protease; the most promising compound 11a inhibited 3CL(pro) inmicromolar range (IC50 = 102.2 muM). Molecular simulations of the target-ligandcomplex in conjunction with dynophore analyses and endpoint free energycalculations provide additional insight and first recommendations for futureoptimization. The fused bicyclo[2.2.2]octenes can be used as a new potentialstarting point in the development of non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) proteaseinhibitors and the study also substantiates the potential of this versatilescaffold for the development of biologically active molecules.

TI  - Effects of Drugs Formerly Suggested for COVID-19 Repurposing on Pannexin1Channels.

LID - 10.3390/ijms23105664 [doi]
AB  - Although many efforts have been made to elucidate the pathogenesis of COVID-19,the underlying mechanisms are yet to be fully uncovered. However, it is knownthat a dysfunctional immune response and the accompanying uncontrollableinflammation lead to troublesome outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Pannexin1channels are put forward as interesting drug targets for the treatment ofCOVID-19 due to their key role in inflammation and their link to other viralinfections. In the present study, we selected a panel of drugs previously tested in clinical trials as potential candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 early onin the pandemic, including hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin,dexamethasone, ribavirin, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, and ritonavir. The effect of the drugs on pannexin1 channels was assessed at a functional level bymeans of measurement of extracellular ATP release. Immunoblot analysis andreal-time quantitative reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction analysiswere used to study the potential of the drugs to alter pannexin1 protein and mRNAexpression levels, respectively. Favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and the combination of lopinavir with ritonavir were found to inhibit pannexin1channel activity without affecting pannexin1 protein or mRNA levels. Thusthreenew inhibitors of pannexin1 channels were identified that, though currently notbeing used anymore for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, could be potentialdrug candidates for other pannexin1-related diseases.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still an active global public healthissue. Although vaccines and therapeutic options are available, some patientsexperience severe conditions and need critical care support. Hence, identifyingkey genes or proteins involved in immune-related severe COVID-19 is necessary to find or develop the targeted therapies. This study proposed a novel construction of an immune-related protein interaction network (IPIN) in severe cases with the use of a network diffusion technique on a human interactome network andtranscriptomic data. Enrichment analysis revealed that the IPIN was mainlyassociated with antiviral, innate immune, apoptosis, cell division, and cellcycle regulation signaling pathways. Twenty-three proteins were identified as keyproteins to find associated drugs. Finally, poly (I:C), mitomycin C, decitabine, gemcitabine, hydroxyurea, tamoxifen, and curcumin were the potential drugsinteracting with the key proteins to heal severe COVID-19. In conclusion, IPINcan be a good representative network for the immune system that integrates theprotein interaction network and transcriptomic data. Thus, the key proteins andtarget drugs in IPIN help to find a new treatment with the use of existing drugs to treat the disease apart from vaccination and conventional antiviral therapy.

TI  - DEEMD: Drug Efficacy Estimation against SARS-CoV-2 based on cell Morphology with Deep multiple instance learning.
LID - 10.1109/TMI.2022.3178523 [doi]
AB  - Drug repurposing can accelerate the identification of effective compounds forclinical use against SARS-CoV-2, with the advantage of pre-existing clinicalsafety data and an established supply chain. RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2manipulate cellular pathways and induce reorganization of subcellular structures to support their life cycle. These morphological changes can be quantified using bioimaging techniques. In this work, we developed DEEMD: a computational pipelineusing deep neural network models within a multiple instance learning framework,to identify putative treatments effective against SARS-CoV-2 based onmorphological analysis of the publicly available RxRx19a dataset. This datasetconsists of fluorescence microscopy images of SARS-CoV-2 non-infected cells andinfected cells, with and without drug treatment. DEEMD first extractsdiscriminative morphological features to generate cell morphological profilesfrom the non-infected and infected cells. These morphological profiles are thenused in a statistical model to estimate the applied treatment efficacy oninfected cells based on similarities to non-infected cells. DEEMD is capable oflocalizing infected cells via weak supervision without any expensive pixel-level annotations. DEEMD identifies known SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, such as Remdesivir andAloxistatin, supporting the validity of our approach. DEEMD can be explored foruse on other emerging viruses and datasets to rapidly identify candidateantiviral treatments in the future. Our implementation is available online athttps: //www.github.com/Sadegh-Saberian/DEEMD.

AB  - The development of specific drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection is a majorchallenge facing global science and healthcare. Despite numerous attempts, there are still no truly effective drugs. Currently, the main approach in the creation of drugs against COVID-19 is repurposing, i.e., re-profiling existing drugsapproved for medical use, for example, the use of a drug for the treatment ofEbola-Remdesivir, and the use of a drug for the treatment ofinfluenza-Favipiravir. However, it is already obvious that these drugs are notspecific enough nor effective enough. Another promising approach is the creation of new molecules, but it should be noted immediately that implementation requiresmuch more time and costs. However, the search for new SARS-CoV-2 specificantiviral agents continues. The aim of our work was the creation of new5-substituted uridine derivatives as potential inhibitors of coronavirusRNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The substances were obtained in high yields by the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction and characterized using modern physicochemical methods.However, testing of their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 did not reveal a significant inhibitory effect.

AB  - The understanding of therapeutic properties is important in drug repositioningand drug discovery. However, chemical or clinical trials are expensive andinefficient to characterize the therapeutic properties of drugs. Recently,artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted algorithms have received extensiveattention for discovering the potential therapeutic properties of drugs andspeeding up drug development. In this study, we propose a new method based onGraphSAGE and clustering constraints (DRGCC) to investigate the potentialtherapeutic properties of drugs for drug repositioning. First, the drug structurefeatures and disease symptom features are extracted. Second, the drug-druginteraction network and disease similarity network are constructed according tothe drug-gene and disease-gene relationships. Matrix factorization is adopted to extract the clustering features of networks. Then, all the features are fed tothe GraphSAGE to predict new associations between existing drugs and diseases.Benchmark comparisons on two different datasets show that our method has reliablepredictive performance and outperforms other six competing. We have alsoconducted case studies on existing drugs and diseases and aimed to predict drugs that may be effective for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Amongthe predicted anti-COVID-19 drug candidates, some drugs are being clinicallystudied by pharmacologists, and their binding sites to COVID-19-related proteinreceptors have been found via the molecular docking technology.

AB  - The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (SCoV-2) has impacted the world in many waysand the virus continues to evolve and produce novel variants with the ability to cause frequent global outbreaks. Although the advent of the vaccines abated theglobal burden, they were not effective against all the variants of SCoV-2. Thistrend warrants shifting the focus on the development of small molecules targetingthe crucial proteins of the viral replication machinery as effective therapeutic solutions. The PLpro is a crucial enzyme having multiple roles during the virallife cycle and is a well-established drug target. In this study, we identified 12potential inhibitors of PLpro through virtual screening of the FDA-approved drug library. Docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies suggested that thesemolecules bind to the PLpro through multiple interactions. Further, IC50 valuesobtained from enzyme-inhibition assays affirm the stronger affinities of theidentified molecules for the PLpro. Also, we demonstrated high structuralconservation in the catalytic site of PLpro between SCoV-2 and Human Coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) through molecular modelling studies. Based on these similaritiesin PLpro structures and the resemblance in various signalling pathways for thetwo viruses, we propose that HCoV-229E is a suitable surrogate for SCoV-2 indrug-discovery studies. Validating our hypothesis, Mefloquine, which waseffective against HCoV-229E, was found to be effective against SCoV-2 as well in cell-based assays. Overall, the present study demonstrated Mefloquine as apotential inhibitor of SCoV-2 PLpro and its antiviral activity against SCoV-2.Corroborating our findings, based on the in vitro virus inhibition assays, arecent study reported a prophylactic role for Mefloquine against SCoV-2.Accordingly, Mefloquine may further be investigated for its potential as a drugcandidate for the treatment of COVID.

TI  - Drugs repurposing for SARS-CoV-2: new insight of COVID-19 druggability.
LID - 10.1080/14787210.2022.2082944 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The ongoing epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) creates a massive panic worldwide due to the absenceof effective medicines. Developing a new drug or vaccine is time-consuming topass safety and efficacy testing. Therefore, repurposing drugs have beenintroduced to treat COVID-19 until effective drugs are developed. AREA COVERED: Adetailed search of repurposing drugs against SARS-CoV-2 was carried out using thePubMed database, focusing on articles published 2020 years onward. A differentclass of drugs has been described in this article to target hosts and viruses.Based on the previous pandemic experience of SARS-CoV and MERS, several antiviraland antimalarial drugs are discussed here. This review covers the failure of somerepurposed drugs that showed promising activity in the earlier CoV-pandemic butwere found ineffective against SARS-CoV-2. All these discussions demand asuccessful drug development strategy for screening and identifying an effectivedrug for better management of COVID-19. The drug development strategies describedhere will serve a new scope of research for academicians and researchers. EXPERT OPINION: Repurposed drugs have been used since COVID-19 to eradicate diseasepropagation. Drugs found effective for MERS and SARS may not be effective againstSARS-CoV-2. Drug libraries and artificial intelligence are helpful tools toscreen and identify different molecules targeting viruses or hosts.

TI  - Characterization of raloxifene as a potential pharmacological agent againstSARS-CoV-2 and its variants.
PG  - 498
LID - 10.1038/s41419-022-04961-z [doi]
AB  - The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic,which so far has caused over 6 million deaths in 2 years, despite new vaccinesand antiviral medications. Drug repurposing, an approach for the potentialapplication of existing pharmaceutical products to new therapeutic indications,could be an effective strategy to obtain quick answers to medical emergencies.Following a virtual screening campaign on the most relevant viral proteins, weidentified the drug raloxifene, a known Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator(SERM), as a new potential agent to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients. In this paper we report a comprehensive pharmacological characterization ofraloxifene in relevant in vitro models of COVID-19, specifically in Vero E6 andCalu-3 cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2. A large panel of the most commonSARS-CoV-2 variants isolated in Europe, United Kingdom, Brazil, South Africa and India was tested to demonstrate the drug's ability in contrasting the viralcytopathic effect (CPE). Literature data support a beneficial effect byraloxifene against the viral infection due to its ability to interact with viral proteins and activate protective estrogen receptor-mediated mechanisms in thehost cells. Mechanistic studies here reported confirm the significant affinity ofraloxifene for the Spike protein, as predicted by in silico studies, and showthat the drug treatment does not directly affect Spike/ACE2 interaction or viral internalization in infected cell lines. Interestingly, raloxifene can counteract Spike-mediated ADAM17 activation in human pulmonary cells, thus providing newinsights on its mechanism of action. A clinical study in mild to moderateCOVID-19 patients (NCT05172050) has been recently completed. Our contribution to evaluate raloxifene results on SARS-CoV-2 variants, and the interpretation of themechanisms of action will be key elements to better understand the trial results,and to design new clinical studies aiming to evaluate the potential developmentof raloxifene in this indication.

AB  - Cyclophilin A (CypA) is linked to diverse human diseases including viralinfections. With the worldwide emergence of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), drug repurposing has been highlighted as a strategy with thepotential to speed up antiviral development. Because CypA acts as a proviralcomponent in hepatitis C virus, coronavirus and HIV, its inhibitors have beensuggested as potential treatments for these infections. Here, we review thestructure of cyclosporin A and sanglifehrin A analogs as well as syntheticmicromolecules inhibiting CypA; and we discuss their broad-spectrum antiviralefficacy in the context of the virus lifecycle.

AB  - MOTIVATION: The outbreak of coronavirus health issues caused byCOVID-19(SARS-CoV-2) creates a global threat to public health. Therefore, thereis a need for effective remedial measures using existing and approved therapieswith proven safety measures has several advantages. Dexamethasone (Pubchem ID:CID0000005743), baricitinib(Pubchem ID: CID44205240), remdesivir (PubchemID:CID121304016) are three generic drugs that have demonstrated in-vitro highantiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. The present study aims to widen the searchand explore the anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties of these potential drugs while lookingfor new drug indications with optimised benefits via in-silico research. METHOD: Here, we designed a unique drug-similarity model to repurpose existing drugsagainst SARS-CoV-2, using the anti-Covid properties of dexamethasone,baricitinib, and remdesivir as references. Known chemical-chemical interactionsof reference drugs help extract interactive compounds withimprovedanti-SARS-CoV-2properties. Here, we calculated the likelihood of these drug compounds treatingSARS-CoV-2 related symptoms using chemical-protein interactions between theinteractive compounds of the reference drugs and SARS-CoV-2 target genes. Inparticular, we adopted a two-tier clustering approach to generate a drugsimilarity model for the final selection of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugmolecules. Tier-1 clustering was based on t-Distributed Stochastic NeighborEmbedding (t-SNE) and aimed to filter and discard outlier drugs. The tier-2analysis incorporated two cluster analyses performed in parallel using OrderingPoints To Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS) and HierarchicalAgglomerative Clustering (HAC). As a result, itidentified clusters of drugs with similar actions. In addition, we carried out a docking study for in-silicovalidation of top candidate drugs. RESULT: Our drug similarity model highlighted ten drugs, including reference drugs that can act as potential therapeuticsagainst SARS-CoV-2. The docking results suggested that doxorubicin showed theleast binding energy compared to reference drugs. Their practical utility asanti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, either individually or in combination, warrants furtherinvestigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2. Due to its rapid spread, in March 2020 the World HealthOrganization (WHO) declared pandemic. Since the outbreak of pandemic manygovernments, scientists, and institutions started to work on new vaccines andfinding of new and repurposing drugs. Drug repurposing is an excellent option fordiscovery of already used drugs, effective against COVID-19, lowering the cost ofproduction, and shortening the period of delivery, especially when preclinicalsafety studies have already been performed. There are many approved drugs thatshowed significant results against COVID-19, like ivermectin andhydrochloroquine, including alternative treatment options against COVID-19,utilizing herbal medicine. SHORT CONCLUSION: This article summarized 11repurposing drugs, their positive and negative health implications, along withtraditional herbal alternatives, that harvest strong potential in efficienttreatments options against COVID-19, with small or no significant side effects.Out of 11 repurposing drugs, four drugs are in status of emergency approval, mostof them being in phase IV clinical trials. The first repurposing drug approvedfor clinical usage is remdesivir, whereas chloroquine and hydrochloroquineapproval for emergency use was revoked by FDA for COVID-19 treatment in June2020.

AB  - Cathepsin L (CTSL), a cysteine protease that can cleave and activate the severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein, could be apromising therapeutic target for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However,there is still no clinically available CTSL inhibitor that can be used. Here, we applied Chemprop, a newly trained directed-message passing deep neural networkapproach, to identify small molecules and FDA-approved drugs that can block CTSL activity to expand the discovery of CTSL inhibitors for drug development andrepurposing for COVID-19. We found 5 molecules (Mg-132, Z-FA-FMK, leupeptinhemisulfate, Mg-101 and calpeptin) that were able to significantly inhibit theactivity of CTSL in the nanomolar range and inhibit the infection of bothpseudotype and live SARS-CoV-2. Notably, we discovered that daptomycin, anFDA-approved antibiotic, has a prominent CTSL inhibitory effect and can inhibitSARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection. Further, molecular docking calculation showedstable and robust binding of these compounds with CTSL. In conclusion, this studysuggested for the first time that Chemprop is ideally suited to predictadditional inhibitors of enzymes and revealed the noteworthy strategy forscreening novel molecules and drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 and otherdiseases with unmet needs.

TI  - Repurposing of Doxycycline to Hinder the Viral Replication of SARS-CoV-2: From insilico to in vitro Validation.
PG  - 757418
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.757418 [doi]
AB  - Since the rapid spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) became a globalpandemic, healthcare ministries around the world have recommended specificcontrol methods such as quarantining infected peoples, identifying infections,wearing mask, and practicing hand hygiene. Since no effective treatment forCOVID-19 has yet been discovered, a variety of drugs approved by Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) have been suggested for repurposing strategy. In the currentstudy, we predicted that doxycycline could interact with the nucleotidetriphosphate (NTP) entry channel, and is therefore expected to hinder the viralreplication of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) through dockinganalysis. Further, the molecular dynamics results revealed that theRdRp-Doxycycline complex was structurally relatively stable during the dynamicperiod (100 ns), and its complex maintained close contact with their activecatalytic domains of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmannsurface area (MM-PBSA) calculation of binding free energy also showed that thedoxycycline has worthy affinities with SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. As expected, doxycycline effectively inhibited the viral replication of IHU strains of SARS-CoV-2 (IHUMI-3and IHUMI-6), identified from the hospitalized patients in IHU MediterraneeInfection (IHUMI), Marseille, France. Moreover, doxycycline inhibited the viralload in vitro at both on-entry and after viral entry of IHU variants ofSARS-CoV-2. The results suggest that doxycycline exhibits strains-dependantantiviral activity against COVID-19. As a result, the current study concludesthat doxycycline may be more effective in combination with other drugs for betterCOVID-19 treatment efficacy.

AB  - The WHO has declared the Covid-19 outbreak as a global health emergency with amortality rate of approximately 3%, across 200 countries. There has been aconsiderable risk involved with drug repurposing in Covid-19 treatment,particularly in patients with underlying chronic disorders. Intervention ofappropriate adjunct to primary drug therapy at subclinical or clinical doses may help to reduce unintended consequences involved in Covid-19 therapy. Metalnanoparticles due to their intrinsic structural and functional properties, notonly contribute to anti-viral properties but also help to reduce the risk forassociated complications. Although, silver nanoparticles hold great promise as aneffective biocidal agent, while other metal nanoparticles also fueled interestagainst virus infection. The present review discusses the important properties ofselected metal nanoparticles, their antiviral principle with possible toxicconsequences, provides invaluable information for scientists and clinicians aboutan appropriate metal nanoparticle as an adjunct for Covid-19 treatment.

AB  - At the center of the SARS-CoV2 infection, the spike protein and its interactionwith the human receptor ACE2 play a central role in the molecular machinery ofSARS-CoV2 infection of human cells. Vaccine therapies are a valuable barrier tothe worst effects of the virus and to its diffusion, but the need of purposeddrugs is emerging as a core target of the fight against COVID19. In this respect,the repurposing of drugs has already led to discovery of drugs thought to reduce the effects of the cytokine storm, but still a drug targeting the spike protein, in the infection stage, is missing. In this work, we present a multifacetedcomputational approach strongly grounded on a biophysical modeling of biological systems, so to disclose the interaction of the SARS-CoV2 spike protein with ACE2 with a special focus to an allosteric regulation of the spike-ACE2 interaction.Our approach includes the following methodologies: Protein Contact Networks andNetwork Clustering, Targeted Molecular Dynamics, Elastic Network Modeling,Perturbation Response Scanning, and a computational analysis of energy flow andSEPAS as a protein-softness and monomer-based affinity predictor. We applied thisapproach to free (closed and open) states of spike protein and spike-ACE2complexes. Eventually, we analyzed the interactions of free and bound forms ofspike with hepcidin (HPC), the major hormone in iron regulation, recentlyaddressed as a central player in the COVID19 pathogenesis, with a specialemphasis to the most severe outcomes. Our results demonstrate that, compared withclosed and open states, the spike protein in the ACE2-bound state shows higherallosteric potential. The correspondence between hinge sites and the AllostericModulation Region (AMR) in the S-ACE complex suggests a molecular basis forhepcidin involvement in COVID19 pathogenesis. We verify the importance of AMR in different states of spike and then study its interactions with HPC and theconsequence of the HPC-AMR interaction on spike dynamics and its affinity forACE2. We propose two complementary mechanisms for HPC effects on spike ofSARS-CoV-2; (a) HPC acts as a competitive inhibitor when spike is in apreinfection state (open and with no ACE2), (b) the HPC-AMR interaction pushesthe spike structure into the safer closed state. These findings need clearmolecular in vivo verification beside clinical observations.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, publicdebates overtly addressed the promises of new innovative drugs. Many of thesedebates pitted those who advocated for the development of new drugs bypharmaceutical companies against those who favored the repositioning of existing drugs. Our study explored perceptions of the association between drug novelty andeffectiveness as well as perceptions of the role of the pharmaceutical industryin drug development. METHODS: Data were collected in January 2021 from a quotasample of the French population aged 18-75years (n=1,000) during the second roundof the "Health Literacy Survey 2019" (HLS19). RESULTS: We tested the hypothesisthat individuals with a high level of familiarity with the health care system andthose with a high level of trust in institutions are more likely to agree thatnew drugs are more effective than old ones and that drug development should bedriven by the pharmaceutical industry. A quarter (25%) of respondents agreed thatnew drugs are always more effective than old ones. Agreement with this statement was stronger among respondents with a high level of familiarity with the healthcare system (as measured by the navigational health literacy score, OR 3.34[2.13-5.24]). Respondents with a low level of trust in pharmaceutical companiesor politicians were two times less likely to agree that new drugs are always moreeffective than old ones (OR 0.63 [0.42-0.95] and OR 0.68 [0.49-0.94],respectively). A high level of trust in pharmaceutical companies was reported by 42% of respondents, and 43% agreed that drug development should be driven by the pharmaceutical industry. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the perceivedeffectiveness of innovative drugs is associated with familiarity with the health care system and trust in institutions.

AB  - Recurrent waves of COVID19 remain a major global health concern. Repurposingeither FDA-approved or clinically advanced drug candidates can save time andeffort required for validating the safety profile and FDA approval. However, the selection of appropriate screening approaches is key to identifying novelcandidate drugs with a higher probability of clinical success. Here, we report a rapid, stratified two-step screening approach using pseudovirus entry inhibition assay followed by an infectious prototypic SARS CoV2 cytotoxic effect inhibition assay in multiple cell lines. Using this approach, we screened a library ofFDA-approved and clinical-stage drugs and identified four compounds, apilimod,berbamine, cepharanthine and (S)-crizotinib which potently inhibited SARSCoV2-induced cell death. Importantly, these drugs exerted similar inhibitoryeffect on the delta and omicron variants although they replicated lessefficiently than the prototypic strain. Apilimod is currently under clinicaltrial (NCT04446377) for COVID19 supporting the validity and robustness of ourscreening approach.

AB  - Drug repurposing has the advantage of shortening regulatory preclinicaldevelopment steps. Here, we screened a library of drug compounds, alreadyregistered in one or several geographical areas, to identify those exhibitingantiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 with relevant potency. Of the 1,942compounds tested, 21 exhibited a substantial antiviral activity in Vero-81 cells.Among them, clofoctol, an antibacterial drug used for the treatment of bacterial respiratory tract infections, was further investigated due to its favorablesafety profile and pharmacokinetic properties. Notably, the peak concentration ofclofoctol that can be achieved in human lungs is more than 20 times higher thanits IC50 measured against SARS-CoV-2 in human pulmonary cells. This compoundinhibits SARS-CoV-2 at a post-entry step. Lastly, therapeutic treatment of human ACE2 receptor transgenic mice decreased viral load, reduced inflammatory geneexpression and lowered pulmonary pathology. Altogether, these data stronglysupport clofoctol as a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of COVID-19patients.

TI  - Forging Ahead the Repositioning of Multitargeted Drug Ivermectin.
LID - 10.2174/1567201819666220516163242 [doi]
AB  - With the advent of ivermectin, tremendous improvement in public health has beenobserved, especially in the treatment of onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis that created chaos mostly in rural, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin Americancountries. The discovery of ivermectin became a boon to millions of people thathad suffered in the pandemic and still hold its pharmacological potential againstthese. Ivermectin continued to surprise scientists because of its notable role inthe treatment of various other tropical diseases (Chagas, leishmaniasis, worminfections, etc.) and is viewed as the safest drug with the least toxic effects. The current review highlights its role in unexplored avenues towards forgingahead of the repositioning of this multitargeted drug in cancer, viral (theevaluation of the efficacy of ivermectin against SARS-Cov-2 is underinvestigation) and bacterial infection and malaria. This article also provides a glimpse of regulatory considerations of drug repurposing and current formulation strategies. Due to its broad-spectrum activity, multitargeted nature andpromising efforts are put towards the repurposing of this drug throughout thefield of medicine. This single drug originated from a microbe, changed the faceof global health by proving its unmatched success and progressive effortscontinue in maintaining its bequestnin the management of global health bydecreasing the burden of various diseases worldwide.

TI  - Invalidation of dieckol and 1,2,3,4,6-pentagalloylglucose (PGG) as SARS-CoV-2main protease inhibitors and the discovery of PGG as a papain-like proteaseinhibitor.
PG  - 1147-1153

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic spurred a broad interest in antiviral drug discovery. TheSARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) and papain-like protease (PL(pro)) areattractive antiviral drug targets given their vital roles in viral replicationand modulation of host immune response. Structurally disparate compounds werereported as M(pro) and PL(pro) inhibitors from either drug repurposing orrational design. Two polyphenols dieckol and 1,2,3,4,6-pentagalloylglucose (PGG) were recently reported as SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) inhibitors. With our continuousinterest in studying the mechanism of inhibition and resistance of M(pro)inhibitors, we report herein our independent validation/invalidation of these twonatural products. Our FRET-based enzymatic assay showed that neither dieckol nor PGG inhibited SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) (IC50 > 20 microM), which is in contrary toprevious reports. Serendipitously, PGG was found to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2PL(pro) with an IC50 of 3.90 microM. The binding of PGG to PL(pro) was furtherconfirmed in the thermal shift assay. However, PGG was cytotoxic in 293T-ACE2cells (CC50 = 7.7 microM), so its intracellular PL(pro) inhibitory activity couldnot be quantified by the cell-based Flip-GFP PL(pro) assay. In addition, we also invalidated ebselen, disulfiram, carmofur, PX12, and tideglusib as SARS-CoV-2PL(pro) inhibitors using the Flip-GFP assay. Overall, our results call forstringent hit validation, and the serendipitous discovery of PGG as a putativePL(pro) inhibitor might worth further pursuing. Graphical abstract.

AB  - The alarming pandemic situation of novel Severe Acute Respiratory SyndromeCoronavirus 2 (nSARS-CoV-2) infection, high drug development cost and slowprocess of drug discovery have made repositioning of existing drugs fortherapeutics a popular alternative. It involves the repurposing of existing safe compounds which results in low overall development costs and shorter development timeline. In the present study, a computational network-biology approach has beenused for comparing three candidate drugs i.e. quercetin, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC),and 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) to be effectively repurposed against COVID-19. Forthis, the associations between these drugs and genes of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) diseases wereretrieved and a directed drug-gene-gene-disease interaction network wasconstructed. Further, to quantify the associations between a target gene and adisease gene, the shortest paths from the target gene to the disease genes wereidentified. A vector DV was calculated to represent the extent to which a diseasegene was influenced by these drugs. Quercetin was quantified as the best amongthe three drugs, suited for repurposing with DV of -70.19, followed by NAC withDV of -39.99 and 2-DG with DV of -13.71. The drugs were also assessed for theirsafety and efficacy balance (in terms of therapeutic index) using networkproperties. It was found that quercetin was a forerunner than other two drugs.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) enters the cell byinteracting with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptorthrough the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike (S) protein. In the cell, the viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) enzyme is essential for its life cycle and controls coronavirus replication. Therefore, the S-RBD and 3CLpro are hot targets for drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2. This study was to identifyrepurposing drugs using in silico screening, docking, and molecular dynamicssimulation. The study identified bentiamine, folic acid, benfotiamine, andvitamin B12 against the RBD of S protein and bentiamine, folic acid,fursultiamine, and riboflavin to 3CLpro. The strong and stable binding of thesesafe and cheap vitamins at the important residues (R403, K417, Y449, Y453, N501, and Y505) in the S-protein-ACE2 interface and 3CLpro binding site residuesespecially active site residues (His 41 and Cys 145), indicating that they could be valuable repurpose drugs for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host andreplication.

AB  - The spread of coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) is associated with thesevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has riskedpublic health more than any other infectious disease. Researchers around theglobe use multiple approaches to identify an effective approved drug (drugrepurposing) that treats viral infections. Most of the drug repurposingapproaches target spike protein or main protease. Here we use transmembraneserine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) as a target that can prevent the virus entry into thecell by interacting with the surface receptors. By hypothesizing that the TMPRSS2binders may help prevent the virus entry into the cell, we performed a systematicdrug screening over the current approved drug database. Furthermore, we screened the Enamine REAL fragments dataset against the TMPRSS2 and presented ninepotential drug-like compounds that give us clues about which kinds of groups the pocket prefers to bind, aiding future structure-based drug design for COVID-19.Also, we employ molecular dynamics simulations, binding free energy calculations,and well-tempered metadynamics to validate the obtained candidate drug andfragment list. Our results suggested three potential FDA-approved drugs againsthuman TMPRSS2 as a target. These findings may pave the way for more drugs to beexposed to TMPRSS2, and testing the efficacy of these drugs with biochemicalexperiments will help improve COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - In December 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) wasfirst identified in the province of Wuhan, China. Since then, there have beenover 400 million confirmed cases and 5.8 million deaths by COVID-19 reportedworldwide. The urgent need for therapies against SARS-CoV-2 led researchers touse drug repurposing approaches. This strategy allows the reduction in risks,time, and costs associated with drug development. In many cases, a repurposeddrug can enter directly to preclinical testing and clinical trials, thusaccelerating the whole drug discovery process. In this work, we will give ageneral overview of the main developments in COVID-19 treatment, focusing on the contribution of the drug repurposing paradigm to find effective drugs againstthis disease. Finally, we will present our findings using a new drug repurposing strategy that identified 11 compounds that may be potentially effective againstCOVID-19. To our knowledge, seven of these drugs have never been tested againstSARS-CoV-2 and are potential candidates for in vitro and in vivo studies toevaluate their effectiveness in COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 causing the COVID-19 pandemic, has highlighted how a combination of urgency, collaboration and building on existing research canenable rapid vaccine development to fight disease outbreaks. However, evencountries with high vaccination rates still see surges in case numbers and highnumbers of hospitalized patients. The development of antiviral treatments henceremains a top priority in preventing hospitalization and death of COVID-19patients, and eventually bringing an end to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. TheSARS-CoV-2 proteome contains several essential enzymatic activities embeddedwithin its non-structural proteins (nsps). We here focus on nsp3, that harboursan essential papain-like protease (PLpro) domain responsible for cleaving theviral polyprotein as part of viral processing. Moreover, nsp3/PLpro also cleaves ubiquitin and ISG15 modifications within the host cell, derailing innate immuneresponses. Small molecule inhibition of the PLpro protease domain significantlyreduces viral loads in SARS-CoV-2 infection models, suggesting that PLpro is anexcellent drug target for next generation antivirals. In this review we discussthe conserved structure and function of PLpro and the ongoing efforts to designsmall molecule PLpro inhibitors that exploit this knowledge. We first discuss themany drug repurposing attempts, concluding that it is unlikely thatPLpro-targeting drugs already exist. We next discuss the wealth of structuralinformation on SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibition, for which there are now approximately30 distinct crystal structures with small molecule inhibitors bound in asurprising number of distinct crystallographic settings. We focus on optimisationof an existing compound class, based on SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitor GRL-0617, andrecapitulate how new GRL-0617 derivatives exploit different features of PLpro, toovercome some compound liabilities.

AB  - Type I interferon (IFN-I) signalling represents a major target for modulation in a virus' bid for latency. IFN-I perturbations are also present in such asAlzheimer's disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS), where viral infections are known to increase symptomatic burden. IFN-I modulation such as via IFNbeta-1a, anestablished MS treatment, has been researched to a limited extent to both AD and COVID-19. In this mini review, we present emerging research on trained immunityas a pathogenetic basis for Alzheimer's disease and the emerging context forIFNbeta-1a repositioning, via mechanisms shared with multiple sclerosis andinduced by viral infections.

TI  - Abiraterone Acetate Attenuates SARS-CoV-2 Replication by Interfering with theStructural Nucleocapsid Protein.
LID - 10.4062/biomolther.2022.037 [doi]
AB  - The drug repurposing strategy has been applied to the development of emergencyCOVID-19 therapeutic medicines. Current drug repurposing approaches have beendirected against RNA polymerases and viral proteases. Recently, we found that theinhibition of the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 structural nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins decreased viral replication. In this study, drugrepurposing candidates were screened by in silico molecular docking simulationwith the SARS-CoV-2 structural N protein. In the ChEMBL database, 1994FDA-approved drugs were selected for the in silico virtual screening against the N terminal domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. The tyrosine 109 residue in the NTD of the N protein was used as the center of the ligand binding grid forthe docking simulation. In plaque forming assays performed with SARS-CoV-2infected Vero E6 cells, atovaquone, abiraterone acetate, and digoxin exhibited a tendency to reduce the size of the viral plagues without affecting the plaquenumbers. Abiraterone acetate significantly decreased the accumulation of viralparticles in the cell culture supernatants in a concentration-dependent manner.In addition, abiraterone acetate significantly decreased the production of Nprotein and S protein in the SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells. In conclusion,abiraterone acetate has therapeutic potential to inhibit the viral replication ofSARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The emergence of pandemic situations originated from severe acute respiratorysyndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 and its new variants created worldwide medical emergencies.Due to the non-availability of efficient drugs and vaccines at these emergencyhours, repurposing existing drugs can effectively treat patients criticallyinfected by SARS-CoV-2. Finding a suitable repurposing drug with inhibitoryefficacy to a host-protein is challenging. A detailed mechanistic understandingof the kinetics, (dis)association pathways, key protein residues facilitating theentry-exit of the drugs with targets are fundamental in selecting theserepurposed drugs. Keeping this target as the goal of the paper, the potentialrepurposing drugs, Nafamostat, Camostat, Silmitasertib, Valproic acid, andZotatifin with host-proteins HDAC2, CSK22, eIF4E2 are studied to elucidateenergetics, kinetics, and dissociation pathways. From an ensemble of independent simulations, we observed the presence of single or multiple dissociation pathwayswith varying host-proteins-drug systems and quantitatively estimated theprobability of unbinding through these specific pathways. We also explored thecrucial gateway residues facilitating these dissociation mechanisms.Interestingly, the residues we obtained for HDAC2 and CSK22 are also involved in the catalytic activity. Our results demonstrate how these potential drugsinteract with the host machinery and the specific target residues, showinginvolvement in the mechanism. Most of these drugs are in the preclinical phase,and some are already being used to treat severe COVID-19 patients. Hence, themechanistic insight presented in this study is envisaged to support furtherfindings of clinical studies and eventually develop efficient inhibitors to treatSARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Outpatient treatment options for mild to moderate COVID-19 are severely limited. While many therapeutic options have been proposed, very few have demonstrated theappropriate safety and efficacy to warrant approval by national or international regulatory bodies. Monoclonal antibodies have been shown to decreasehospitalization in high-risk patients, but use remains limited due to challenges associated with both production and administration, and other treatment optionsare urgently needed. The anti-inflammatory drug fluticasone propionate hasrecently emerged as a potential outpatient treatment option, especially for thosewith newly diagnosed disease. This manuscript reviews what is known aboutfluticasone and looks ahead to examine how the drug may be used in the future to address the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has set back progress made on antimicrobial resistance(AMR). Without urgent re-focus, we risk slowing down drug discovery and providingtreatment for drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Unique in its immuneevasion, dormancy and resuscitation, the causal pathogens of tuberculosis (TB)have demonstrated resistance to antibiotics with efflux pumps and the ability to form biofilms. Repurposing drugs is a prospective avenue for finding new anti-TB drugs. There are many advantages to discovering novel targets of an existingdrug, as the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties have already beenestablished, they are cost-efficient and can be commercially accelerated for the new development. One such group of drugs are non-steroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs (NSAIDs) that are originally known for their ability to supress the hostproinflammatory responses. In addition to their anti-inflammatory properties,some NSAIDs have been discovered to have antimicrobial modes of action. Ofparticular interest is Carprofen, identified to inhibit the efflux mechanism and disrupt biofilm formation in mycobacteria. Due to the complexities ofhost-pathogens interactions in the lung microbiome, inflammatory responses mustcarefully be controlled alongside the in vivo actions of the prospectiveanti-infectives. This critical review explores the potential dual role of aselection of NSAIDs, as an anti-inflammatory and anti-tubercular adjunct toreverse the tide of antimicrobial resistance in existing treatments.

AB  - The advent and spread of novel coronavirus viruses (nCoV), has been presentingthe planet with a new public health crisis since December 2019. Several cases of unexplained pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, only a monthbefore the Chinese Spring festival. After a diagnosis of broncho-alveolar fluidsamples of people from the Wuhan Seafood Market, the new coronavirus wasidentified using next-generation sequence technology. This work aims to bring outinformation regarding COVID-19 under a common platform that will help theresearchers to identify the vital therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 and, also itwill provide insights into some significant work performed in recent times byscientific communities around the globe. In this review, we have tried to exploremultiple aspects related to COVID-19 that includes: Epidemiology, Etiology,COVID-19 variants, Vaccine candidates, Potential therapeutic targets, role ofnatural products, and computational studies in drug design and development,repurposing, analysis of crystal structures available for COVID-19 relatedprotein structures. Druggable targets include all viral enzymes and proteinsinvolved in viral replication and regulation of host cellular machines. Themedical community is tracking several therapies to combat the infection by using various antiviral and immunomodulatory mechanisms. While some vaccines areapproved in this world-wide health crisis, a more precise therapy or drug isformally recommended to be used against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Natural productsother than synthetic drugs, have been tested by in silico analysis againstCOVID-19. However, important issues still need to be addressed regarding in vivo bioavailability and better efficacy.

AB  - The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged asthe causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemicthat has spread worldwide, resulting in over 6 million deaths as of March 2022.Older people have been disproportionately affected by the disease, as they have agreater risk of hospitalization, are more vulnerable to severe infection, andhave higher mortality than younger patients. Although effective vaccines havebeen rapidly developed and administered globally, several clinical trials areongoing to repurpose existing drugs to combat severe infection. One such drug,rapamycin, is currently under study for this purpose, given its immunosuppressanteffects that are mediated by its inhibition of the mechanistic target ofrapamycin (mTOR), a master regulator of cell growth. Consistent with thispremise, acute rapamycin administration in young healthy humans blocks orattenuates mTOR and its downstream effectors, leading to the inhibition of muscleprotein synthesis (MPS). Skeletal muscle mass declines when MPS is chronicallylower than muscle protein breakdown. This is consequential for older people whoare more susceptible to anabolic resistance (i.e., the blunting of MPS) due toreduced activity, sedentariness, or bed rest such as that associated withCOVID-19 hospitalization, and who have also demonstrated a delayed or bluntedability to regain inactivity-induced muscle loss. The lack of studiesinvestigating rapamycin administration on skeletal muscle in older people, andthe emergence of effective antiviral medications against severe infection, mayindicate the reduced relevance of drug repurposing for present or futurepandemics.

AB  - COVID -19 a global pandemic that has brought all the greater global countries to a hook. The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak was first reported in Wuhan, China which then started spreading to different countries around the world. ACE2 receptors are present in various organs but the overexpression of ACE2 at lungepithelia makes them more vulnerable to respiratory symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 binds toACE2 receptors for entry into host cells which may serve as potential target for future therapy.Repurposing of drugs are the present strategy undertaken as theSARS-CoV-2 shows similar respiratory distress symptoms as in the case of SARS andMERS. At present the antiviral medications and vaccines are at the early stagesand may take few months to years, to achieve their complete efficacy to solve thepublic crisis. The technological advancements have brought passive immunisation, which is an anecdotal success, but the ideal approach to future outbreaks ofSARS-CoV-2 is done by vaccines that are under clinical trials. There are a large percentage of population under psychological crisis either due to the fear ofinfection or stress from the quarantine lives. High levels of viral loads at the initial stages cause higher chances of transmission hence immediate isolationsand screening methods must be undertaken. This review mainly focuses on thetreatment strategies followed with no definitive approval from authorities. This is an attempt to gather all the materialistic evidences available for now.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spurred a boom in uncovering repurposable existing drugs. Drug repurposing is a strategy for identifying newuses for approved or investigational drugs that are outside the scope of theoriginal medical indication. MOTIVATION: Current works of drug repurposing forsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are mostly limitedto only focusing on chemical medicines, analysis of single drug targeting single SARS-CoV-2 protein, one-size-fits-all strategy using the same treatment (samedrug) for different infected stages of SARS-CoV-2. To dilute these issues, weinitially set the research focusing on herbal medicines. We then proposed aheterogeneous graph embedding method to signaled candidate repurposing herbs for each SARS-CoV-2 protein, and employed the variational graph convolutional networkapproach to recommend the precision herb combinations as the potential candidate treatments against the specific infected stage. METHOD: We initially employed thevirtual screening method to construct the 'Herb-Compound' and 'Compound-Protein' docking graph based on 480 herbal medicines, 12,735 associated chemical compoundsand 24 SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Sequentially, the 'Herb-Compound-Protein'heterogeneous network was constructed by means of the metapath-based embeddingapproach. We then proposed the heterogeneous-information-network-based graphembedding method to generate the candidate ranking lists of herbs that targetstructural, nonstructural and accessory SARS-CoV-2 proteins, individually. Toobtain precision synthetic effective treatments forvarious COVID-19 infectedstages, we employed the variational graph convolutional network method togenerate candidate herb combinations as the recommended therapeutic therapies.RESULTS: There were 24 ranking lists, each containing top-10 herbs, targeting 24 SARS-CoV-2 proteins correspondingly, and 20 herb combinations were generated asthe candidate-specific treatment to target the four infected stages.

AB  - During the past few months, mucormycosis has been associated with SARS-CoV-2infections. Molecular docking combined with molecular dynamics simulation isutilized to test nucleotide-based inhibitors against the RdRps of SARS-CoV-2solved structure and Rhizopus oryzae RdRp model built in silico. The resultsreveal a comparable binding affinity of sofosbuvir, galidesivir, ribavirin andremdesivir compared with the physiological nucleotide triphosphates against R.oryzae RdRp as well as the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp as reported before. Additionally,other compounds such as setrobuvir, YAK, IDX-184 and modified GTP compounds 2, 3 and 4 show potential calculated average binding affinities against R. oryzaeRdRp. The present in silico study suggests the dual inhibition potential of therecommended drugs and compounds against SARS-CoV-2 and R. oryzae RdRps.

TI  - Artificial Neural Network-Based Study Predicts GS-441524 as a Potential Inhibitorof SARS-CoV-2 Activator Protein Furin: a Polypharmacology Approach.
LID - 10.1007/s12010-022-03928-2 [doi]
AB  - Furin, a pro-protein convertase, plays a significant role as a biological scissorin bacterial, viral, and even mammalian substrates which in turn decides the fateof many viral and bacterial infections along with the numerous ailments caused bycancer, diabetes, inflammations, and neurological disorders. In the wake of thecurrent pandemic caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, furin has become the center ofattraction for researchers as the spike protein contains a polybasic furincleavage site. In the present work, we have searched for novel inhibitors againstthis interesting human target from FDA-approved antiviral. To enhance theselection of new inhibitors, we employed Kohonen's artificial neuralnetwork-based self-organizing maps for ligand-based virtual screening. Promising results were obtained which can help in drug repurposing and network pharmacologystudies can address the errors generated due to promiscuity/polypharmacology. We found 15 existing FDA antiviral drugs having the potential to inhibit furin.Among these, six compounds have targets on important human proteins (LDLR,FCGR1A, PCK1, TLR7, DNA, and PNP). The role of these 15 drugs inhibiting furincan be established by studying further on patients infected with number ofviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Here we propose two promising candidate FDA drugsGS-441524 and Grazoprevir (MK-5172) for repurposing as inhibitors of furin. Thebest results were observed with GS-441524.

TI  - Discovery of adapalene and dihydrotachysterol as antiviral agents for the Omicronvariant of SARS-CoV-2 through computational drug repurposing.
LID - 10.1007/s11030-022-10440-6 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has beensignificantly paralyzing the societies, economies and health care systems around the globe. The mutations on the genome of SARS-CoV-2 led to the emergence of new variants, some of which are classified as "variant of concern" due to theirincreased transmissibility and better viral fitness. The Omicron variant, as the latest variant of concern, dominated the current COVID-19 cases all around theworld. Unlike the previous variants of concern, the Omicron variant has 15mutations on the receptor-binding domain of spike protein and the changes in the key amino acid residues of S protein can enhance the binding ability of the virusto hACE2, resulting in a significant increase in the infectivity of the Omicronvariant. Therefore, there is still an urgent need for treatment and prevention ofvariants of concern, particularly for the Omicron variant. In this study, an insilico drug repurposing was conducted through the molecular docking of 2890FDA-approved drugs against the mutant S protein of SARS-CoV-2 for Omicronvariant. We discovered promising drug candidates for the inhibition of alarmingOmicron variant such as quinestrol, adapalene, tamibarotene, anddihydrotachysterol. The stability of ligands complexed with the mutant S protein was confirmed using MD simulations. The lead compounds were further evaluated fortheir potential use and side effects based on the current literature.Particularly, adapalene, dihydrotachysterol, levocabastine and bexarotene cameinto prominence due to their non-interference with the normal physiologicalprocesses. Therefore, this study suggests that these approved drugs can beconsidered as drug candidates for further in vitro and in vivo studies to developnew treatment options for the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - A micro-molecule of dimension 125 nm has caused around 479 million humaninfections (80 M for the USA) and 6.1 million human deaths (977,000 for the USA) worldwide and slashed the global economy by US$ 8.5 Trillion over two yearsperiod. The only other events in recent history that caused comparative humanlife loss through direct usage (either by human or nature, respectively) ofstructure-property relations of 'nano-structures' (either human-made or nature,respectively) were nuclear bomb attacks during World War II and 1918 FluPandemic. This molecule is called SARS-CoV-2, which causes a disease known asCOVID-19. The high liability cost of the pandemic had incentivized variousprivate, government, and academic entities to work towards finding a cure forthis and emerging diseases. As an outcome, multiple vaccine candidates arediscovered to avoid the infection in the first place. But so far, there has been no success in finding fully effective therapeutic candidates. In this paper, weattempted to provide multiple therapy candidates based upon a sophisticatedmulti-scale in-silico framework, which increases the probability of thecandidates surviving an in-vivo trial. We have selected a group of ligands fromthe ZINC database based upon previously partially successful candidates, i.e.,Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir, Remdesivir, Ritonavir. We have used the following robust framework to screen the ligands; Step-I: high throughput moleculardocking, Step-II: molecular dynamics analysis, Step-III: density functionaltheory analysis. In total, we have analyzed 242,000(ligands)*9(proteins) = 2.178 million unique protein binding site/ligand combinations. The proteins wereselected based on recent experimental studies evaluating potential inhibitorbinding sites. Step-I had filtered that number down to 10 ligands/protein basedon molecular docking binding energy, further screening down to 2 ligands/protein based on drug-likeness analysis. Additionally, these two ligands per protein wereanalyzed in Step-II with a molecular dynamic modeling-based RMSD filter of lessthan 1A. It finally suggested three ligands (ZINC001176619532, ZINC000517580540, ZINC000952855827) attacking different binding sites of the same protein(7BV2),which were further analyzed in Step-III to find the rationale behindcomparatively higher ligand efficacy.

AB  - Exploring the new therapeutic indications of known drugs for treating COVID-19,popularly known as drug repurposing, is emerging as a pragmatic approachespecially owing to the mounting pressure to control the pandemic. Targetingmultiple targets with a single drug by employing drug repurposing known as thepolypharmacology approach may be an optimised strategy for the development ofeffective therapeutics. In this study, virtual screening has been carried out on seven popular SARS-CoV-2 targets (3CL(pro), PL(pro), RdRp (NSP12), NSP13, NSP14, NSP15, and NSP16). A total of 4015 approved drugs were screened against thesetargets. Four drugs namely venetoclax, tirilazad, acetyldigitoxin, and ledipasvirhave been selected based on the docking score, ability to interact with four ormore targets and having a reasonably good number of interactions with keyresidues in the targets. The MD simulations and MM-PBSA studies showed reasonablestability of protein-drug complexes and sustainability of key interactionsbetween the drugs with their respective targets throughout the course of MDsimulations. The identified four drug molecules were also compared with the knowndrugs namely elbasvir and nafamostat. While the study has provided a detailedaccount of the chosen protein-drug complexes, it has explored the nature of sevenimportant targets of SARS-CoV-2 by evaluating the protein-drug complexationprocess in great detail. Graphical abstract: Drug repurposing strategy againstSARS-CoV2 drug targets. Computational analysis was performed to identifyrepurposable approved drug candidates against SARS-CoV2 using approaches such as virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA calculations. Fourdrugs namely venetoclax, tirilazad, acetyldigitoxin, and ledipasvir have beenselected as potential candidates.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a positive-strand RNA virus, andhas rapidly spread worldwide as a pandemic. The vaccines, repurposed drugs, andspecific treatments have led to a surge of novel therapies and guidelinesnowadays; however, the epidemic of COVID-19 is not yet fully combated and isstill in a vital crisis. In repositioning drugs, natural products are gainingattention because of the large therapeutic window and potent antiviral,immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Of note, thepredominant curcumoid extracted from turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) includingphenolic curcumin influences multiple signaling pathways and has demonstrated to possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, hypoglycemic, woundhealing, chemopreventive, chemosensitizing, and radiosensitizing spectrums. Inthis review, all pieces of current information related to curcumin-used for thetreatment and prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) infection through in vitro, in vivo, and in silico studies, clinicaltrials, and new formulation designs are retrieved to re-evaluate the applicationsbased on the pharmaceutical efficacy of clinical therapy and to provide deepinsights into knowledge and strategy about the curcumin's role as an immunebooster, inflammatory modulator, and therapeutic agent against COVID-19.Moreover, this study will also afford a favorable application or approach withevidence based on the drug discovery and development, pharmacology, functionalfoods, and nutraceuticals for effectively fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic continues unabated, emphasizing the need for additionalantiviral treatment options to prevent hospitalization and death of patientsinfected with SARS-CoV-2. The papain-like protease (PLpro) domain is part of the SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein (nsp)-3, and represents an essential proteaseand validated drug target for preventing viral replication. PLpro moonlights as adeubiquitinating (DUB) and deISGylating enzyme, enabling adaptation of a DUB highthroughput (HTS) screen to identify PLpro inhibitors. Drug repurposing has been amajor focus through the COVID-19 pandemic as it may provide a fast and efficient route for identifying clinic-ready, safe-in-human antivirals. We here report our effort to identify PLpro inhibitors by screening the ReFRAME library of 11,804compounds, showing that none inhibit PLpro with any reasonable activity orspecificity to justify further progression towards the clinic. We also report ourlatest efforts to improve piperidine-scaffold inhibitors, 5c and 3k, originallydeveloped for SARS-CoV PLpro. We report molecular details of binding andselectivity, as well as in vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism andexcretion (ADME) studies of this scaffold. A co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2PLpro bound to inhibitor 3k guides medicinal chemistry efforts to improve bindingand ADME characteristics. We arrive at compounds with improved and favorablesolubility and stability characteristics that are tested for inhibiting viralreplication. Whilst still requiring significant improvement, our optimized small molecule inhibitors of PLpro display decent antiviral activity in an in vitroSARS-CoV-2 infection model, justifying further optimization.

AB  - Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has significantly altered thesocio-economic status of countries. Although vaccines are now available againstthe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a causativeagent for COVID-19, it continues to transmit and newer variants of concern havebeen consistently emerging world-wide. Computational strategies involving drugrepurposing offer a viable opportunity to choose a medication from a rundown ofaffirmed drugs against distinct diseases including COVID-19. While pandemicsimpede the healthcare systems, drug repurposing or repositioning represents ahopeful approach in which existing drugs can be remodeled and employed to treatnewer diseases. In this review, we summarize the diverse computational approachesattempted for developing drugs through drug repurposing or repositioning against COVID-19 and discuss their advantages and limitations. To this end, we haveoutlined studies that utilized computational techniques such as moleculardocking, molecular dynamic simulation, disease-disease association, drug-druginteraction, integrated biological network, artificial intelligence, machinelearning and network medicine to accelerate creation of smart and safe drugsagainst COVID-19.

AB  - A smooth, exceptionally sensitive, correct, and extra reproducible RP-HPLCtechnique was developed and demonstrated to estimate Sofosbuvir (SOF) inpharmaceutical dosage formulations. This process was carried out by AgilentHigh-Pressure Liquid Chromatograph 1260 with GI311C Quat. Pump, Phenomenex LunaC-18 (150 mm x 4.6 mm x 5 mum) (USA), and Photodiode Array Detector (PDA) G1315D.The cell section, including acetonitrile and methanol with 80:20 v/v and solution(B) 0.1% phosphoric acid (40:60), was used for the study. However, 10 muL of the sample was injected with a drift flow of 1 mL/min. The separation occurred at acolumn temperature of 30 degrees C, and the eluents used PDA set at 260 nm. Theretention time of SOF was 5 min. The calibration curve was modified linearlywithin the range of 0.05-0.15 mg/mL with a correlation coefficient of 0.99 andgenuine linear dating among top vicinity and consciousness in the calibrationcurve. The detection and quantification restrictions were 0.001 and 0.003 mg/mL, respectively. SOF recovery from pharmaceutical components ranged from 98% to 99%.The percentage assay of SOF was 99%. Analytical validation parameters, such asspecificity, linearity, precision, accuracy, and selectivity, were studied, andthe percentage relative standard deviation (%RSD) was less than 2%. All other keyparameters were observed within the desired thresholds. Hence, the proposedRP-HPLC technique was proven effective for developing SOF in bulk andpharmaceutical pill dosage forms. SOF was found to interact with SARS-COV-2nsp12, and molecular docking results revealed its high affinity and firm binding within the active site groove of nsp12. The key interacting residues include;LYS-72, GLN-75, MET-80 ALA-99, ASN-99, TRP-100, TYR-101 with ASN-99 and TRP-100forming hydrogen bonds. Molecular Dynamics simulation of SOF and nsp12 complexelucidated that the system was stable throughout 20ns. Therefore, this drugrepurposing strategy for SOF can be used for treating COVID-19 infections byperforming animal experiments and accurate clinical trials in the future.

AB  - The unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is triggered by a novelstrain of coronavirus namely, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2). Researchers are working around the clock to control this pandemicand consequent waves of viral reproduction, through repurposing existing drugs aswell as designing new vaccines. Several countries have hastened vaccine designand clinical trials to quickly address this outbreak. Currently, more than 250aspirants against SARS-CoV-2 are in progress, including mRNA-replicating ornon-replicating viral vectored-, DNA-, autologous dendritic cell-based-, andinactivated virus-vaccines. Vaccines work by prompting effector mechanisms suchas cells/molecules, which target quickly replicating pathogens and neutralizetheir toxic constituents. Vaccine-stimulated immune effectors include adjuvant,affinity, avidity, affinity maturation, antibodies, antigen-presenting cells, Blymphocytes, carrier protein, CD4(+) T-helper cells. In this review, we describe updated information on the various vaccines available over the last two decades, along with recent progress in the ongoing battle developing 63 diverse vaccinesagainst SARS-CoV-2. The inspiration of our effort is to convey the currentinvestigation focus on registered clinical trials (as of January 08, 2021) thatsatisfy the safety and efficacy criteria of international wide vaccinedevelopment.

AB  - The main protease (M(pro) or 3CL(pro)) is a conserved cysteine protease from the coronaviruses and started to be considered an important drug target fordeveloping antivirals, as it produced a deadly outbreak of COVID-19. Herein, weused a combination of drug reposition and computational modeling approachesincluding molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and thecalculated binding free energy to evaluate a set of drugs in complex with theM(pro) enzyme. Particularly, our results show that darunavir and triptorelindrugs have favorable binding free energy (-63.70 and -77.28 kcal mol(-1),respectively) in complex with the M(pro) enzyme. Based on the results, thestructural and energetic features that explain why some drugs can be repositionedto inhibit M(pro) from SARS-CoV-2 were exposed. These features should beconsidered for the design of novel M(pro) inhibitors.

LID - 10.1039/d1ra00644d [doi]
AB  - At the end of 2019, a life threatening viral infection (COVID-19) caused by anovel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)was reported. This virus has spread worldwide in a short duration and forced the world to face unprecedented life and economic loss. To date, there are no knownspecific drugs to combat this virus and the process for new drug development islengthy. Most promising candidates, which emerged as potential leads, wereabandoned in the later phases of clinical trials. Repurposing of already approveddrugs for other therapeutic applications can be done only after extensive testingfor safety and efficacy. With no definite therapeutics in the horizon, naturalproducts are in extensive use arbitrarily as anti-viral agents and immuneboosters. For ages it has been known that most natural products possess potentanti-viral activity and it is no different for SARS-CoV-2. It has been shown thatnatural products display inhibitory effects on MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections. In silico studies have shown that various natural products have strong bindingaffinity for and inhibitory action on the non-structural proteins of the virus,namely PL(PRO), M(PRO), and RdRp, and structural proteins such as spike (S)protein. Since the virus utilizes the transmembrane ACE2 receptor of the hostcell, it also proves to be a valid target for drug development. In this reviewpromising targets for drug development against SARS-CoV-2 and anti-viralactivities of some of the known natural products are discussed.

TI  - Lichen planus drugs re-purposing as potential anti COVID-19 therapeutics through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation approach.
PG  - 127-146
AB  - Background and Aim: The present study intends to investigate COVID-19 bytargeting their main proteins with 17 selected drugs used for treating OralLichen Planus (OLP) which is a chronic muco-cutaneous disorder. Here, an attempt is made to gain better insight into the structure of various drugs targetingspecific proteins which will be helpful in developing drugs useful fortherapeutic and preventive measures. Method: In silico studies, molecular dockingand molecular dynamic simulations were performed to repurpose the therapeuticdrugs (n = 17) which were used to treat OLP against COVID-19. In addition, themaximum binding affinities of the key protein spike glycoprotein, main-protease(M(pro)) of coronavirus, and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) in the humanbody were evaluated with the selected drugs. Results: Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) showed the highest docking values among the drugs selected forrepurposing. Among the target proteins, EGCG has shown maximum binding affinitywith ACE-2 receptor. Further, according to the molecular dynamic simulationstudies, EGCG has shown the least conformational fluctuations with M(pro).Conclusion: EGCG can be a potential inhibitor drug which can bind with ACE-2receptor thus inhibiting the interaction of mainly M(pro) protein and spikeglycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Relevance for Patients: EGCG, a natural compoundshows antiviral potential having considerably high affinity and stability withSARS-CoV-2. It might be further employed as a lead drug against selectiveinhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 for the therapeutic management of COVID-19 patientsafter necessary clinical trials.

AB  - The new pandemic produced by coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has becomes the biggestchallenge that the world is facing today. It has been creating a devastatingglobal crisis, causing countless deaths and great panic. The search for aneffective treatment remains a global challenge owing to controversies onavailable vaccines. A huge research effort (clinical, experimental, andcomputational) has emerged in response to this pandemic, and more than 125000research reports have been published in relation with COVID-19. The majority ofthem focused on the discovery of novel drug candidates or repurposing of existingdrugs through computational approaches that significantly speed up drugdiscovery. Among the different used targets, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro),which plays an essential role in coronavirus replication, has become thepreferred target for computational studies. In this review, we examine arepresentative set of computational studies that uses the Mpro as target for the discovery of COVID-19 small molecules. They will be divided into two main groups,structure-based, and ligand-based methods, and each one will be subdividedaccording to the strategies used in the research. From our point of view, the useof combined strategies could enhance the possibilities of success in the future, permitting to develop more rigorous computational studies in future efforts tocombat current and future pandemics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the current COVID-19 pandemic, with an absence of approved drugsand widely accessible vaccines, repurposing existing drugs is vital to quicklydeveloping a treatment for the disease. METHODS: In this study, we used a datasetconsisting of sequences of viral proteins and chemical structures ofpharmaceutical drugs for known drug-target interactions (DTIs) and artificiallygenerated non-interacting DTIs to train a binary classifier with the ability topredict new DTIs. Random Forest (RF), deep neural network (DNN), andconvolutional neural networks (CNN) were tested. The CNN and RF models wereselected for the classification task. RESULTS: The models generalized well to thegiven DTI data and were used to predict DTIs involving SARS-CoV-2 nonstructuralproteins (NSPs). We elucidated (with the CNN) 29 drugs involved in 82 DTIs with a97% probability of interaction, 44 DTIs of which had a 99% probability ofinteraction, to treat COVID-19. The RF elucidated 6 drugs involved in 17 DTIswith a 90% probability of interacting. CONCLUSIONS: These results give newinsight into possible inhibitors of the viral proteins beyond pharmacophoremodels and molecular docking procedures used in recent studies.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused appalling conditions over the globe,which is currently faced by the entire human population. One of the primaryreasons behind the uncontrollable situation is the lack of specific therapeutics.In such conditions, drug repurposing of available drugs (viz. Chloroquine,Lopinavir, etc.) has been proposed, but various clinical and preclinicalinvestigations indicated the toxicity and adverse side effects of these drugs.This study explores the inhibition potency of phytochemicals from Tinosporacordifolia (Giloy) against SARS CoV-2 drugable targets (spike glycoprotein andM(pro) proteins) using molecular docking and MD simulation studies. ADMET,virtual screening, MD simulation, postsimulation analysis (RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, PCA, FES) and MM-PBSA calculations were carried out to predict the inhibitionefficacy of the phytochemicals against SARS CoV-2 targets. Tinospora compoundsshowed better binding affinity than the corresponding reference. Their bindingaffinity ranges from -9.63 to -5.68 kcal/mole with spike protein and -10.27 to-7.25 kcal/mole with main protease. Further 100 ns exhaustive simulation studies and MM-PBSA calculations supported favorable and stable binding of them. Thiswork identifies Nine Tinospora compounds as potential inhibitors. Among those,7-desacetoxy-6,7-dehydrogedunin was found to inhibit both spike (7NEG) and Mpro(7MGS and 6LU7) proteins, and Columbin was found to inhibit selected spiketargets (7NEG and 7NX7). In all the analyses, these compounds performed well and confirms the stable binding. Hence the identified compounds, advocated aspotential inhibitors can be taken for further in vitro and in vivo experimentalvalidation to determine their anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential.Communicated by RamaswamyH.

AB  - Unanticipated pathogenic risk and emerging transmittable diseases can result frominterspecies exchanges of viruses among animals and humans. The emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causingcoronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has recently exemplified thismechanism. Cough, fever, fatigue, headache, sputum production, hemoptysis,dyspnea, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal disorders are the characteristic featuresof the disease. The most prevalent and serious manifestation of the infectiontends to be pneumonia. The new strains of SARS-CoV-2 with more infectivity havebeen emerging at regular intervals. There is currently no World HealthOrganization-approved particular drug for COVID-19. Besides, developing novelantivirals would take much time. Thus, repurposing the application of naturalproducts can provide alternatives and can facilitate medication against COVID-19 as well as can slow down the aggressive progression of the disease before thearrival of approved drugs. Probiotics have long been known for their positiveeffects on the gut microbiome and impact on immune responses. Particularly, theirinvolvement against viral diseases, especially those of the upper and lowerrespiratory tract, is of current interest for their prospective applicationagainst COVID-19. In this review, we comprehensively address the mode of actionof probiotics and their possible intervention against coronavirus diseasescorrelating with their efficacy against viral diseases. In this regard, weexplored recently published relevant research and review articles inMEDLINE/PubMed related to COVID-19 and the effects of probiotics on viralinfections.

LID - 10.1155/2022/9293681 [doi]
AB  - Background: There have been thousands of clinical trials for COVID-19 to targeteffective treatments. However, quite a few of them are traditional randomizedcontrolled trials with low efficiency. Considering the three particularities ofpandemic disease: timeliness, repurposing, and case spike, new trial designs needto be developed to accelerate drug discovery. Methods: We propose an adaptiveinformation borrowing platform design that can sequentially test drug candidates under a unified framework with early efficacy/futility stopping. Power prior isused to borrow information from previous stages and the time trend calibrationmethod deals with the baseline effectiveness drift. Two drug developmentstrategies are applied: the comprehensive screening strategy and the optimalscreening strategy. At the same time, we adopt adaptive randomization to set ahigher allocation ratio to the experimental arms for ethical considerations,which can help more patients to receive the latest treatments and shorten thetrial duration. Results: Simulation shows that in general, our method has greatoperating characteristics with type I error controlled and power increased, whichcan select effective/optimal drugs with a high probability. The early stoppingrules can be successfully triggered to stop the trial when drugs are either trulyeffective or not optimal, and the time trend calibration performs consistentlywell with regard to different baseline drifts. Compared with the nonborrowingmethod, borrowing information in the design substantially improves theprobability of screening promising drugs and saves the sample size. Sensitivityanalysis shows that our design is robust to different design parameters.Conclusions: Our proposed design achieves the goal of gaining efficiency, saving sample size, meeting ethical requirements, and speeding up the trial process and is suitable and well performed for COVID-19 clinical trials to screen promisingtreatments or target optimal therapies.

LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14040877 [doi]
AB  - The development of effective antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 is urgentlyneeded and a global health priority. In light of the initial data regarding therepurposing of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to tackle this coronavirus, herein wepresent a quantitative synthesis and spectroscopic and thermal characterizationof seven HCQ room temperature ionic liquids (HCQ-ILs) obtained by directprotonation of the base with two equivalents of organic sulfonic, sulfuric andcarboxylic acids of different polarities. Two non-toxic and hydrophilic HCQ-ILs, in particular, [HCQH2][C1SO3]2 and [HCQH2][GlcCOO]2, decreased the virus-induced cytopathic effect by two-fold in comparison with the original drug, [HCQH2][SO4].Despite there being no significant differences in viral RNA production betweenthe three compounds, progeny virus production was significantly affected (p &lt; 0.05) by [HCQH2][GlcCOO]2. Overall, the data suggest that the in vitro antiviral activities of the HCQ-ILs are most likely the result of specific intra- andintermolecular interactions and not so much related with their hydrophilic orlipophilic character. This work paves the way for the development of future novelionic formulations of hydroxychloroquine with enhanced physicochemicalproperties.

TI  - Antiviral Activity of Repurposing Ivermectin against a Panel of 30 ClinicalSARS-CoV-2 Strains Belonging to 14 Variants.
LID - 445 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph15040445 [doi]
AB  - Over the past two years, several variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged and spreadall over the world. However, infectivity, clinical severity, re-infection,virulence, transmissibility, vaccine responses and escape, and epidemiologicalaspects have differed between SARS-CoV-2 variants. Currently, very few treatmentsare recommended against SARS-CoV-2. Identification of effective drugs amongrepurposing FDA-approved drugs is a rapid, efficient and low-cost strategyagainst SARS-CoV-2. One of those drugs is ivermectin. Ivermectin is anantihelminthic agent that previously showed in vitro effects against a SARS-CoV-2isolate (Australia/VI01/2020 isolate) with an IC50 of around 2 microM. Weevaluated the in vitro activity of ivermectin on Vero E6 cells infected with 30clinically isolated SARS-CoV-2 strains belonging to 14 different variants, andparticularly 17 strains belonging to six variants of concern (VOC) (variantsrelated to Wuhan, alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron). The in vitro activityof ivermectin was compared to those of chloroquine and remdesivir. Unlikechloroquine (EC50 from 4.3 +/- 2.5 to 29.3 +/- 5.2 microM) or remdesivir (EC50from 0.4 +/- 0.3 to 25.2 +/- 9.4 microM), ivermectin showed a relativelyhomogeneous in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 regardless of the strains orvariants (EC50 from 5.1 +/- 0.5 to 6.7 +/- 0.4 microM), except for one omicronstrain (EC50 = 1.3 +/- 0.5 microM). Ivermectin (No. EC50 = 219, mean EC50 = 5.7+/- 1.0 microM) was, overall, more potent in vitro than chloroquine (No. EC50 =214, mean EC50 = 16.1 +/- 9.0 microM) (p = 1.3 x 10(-34)) and remdesivir (No.EC50 = 201, mean EC50 = 11.9 +/- 10.0 microM) (p = 1.6 x 10(-13)). These results should be interpreted with caution regarding the potential use of ivermectin inSARS-CoV-2-infected patients: it is difficult to translate in vitro study resultsinto actual clinical treatment in patients.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent COVID-19, one of the most impactful healthcrises afflicting humanity in recent decades. While research advances haveyielded several treatment and prevention options, the pandemic is slow to abate, necessitating an expansion of our treatment arsenal. As a member of thecoronaviridae, SARS-CoV-2 contains several ion channels, of which E and 3a arethe best characterized. Since ion channels as a family are excellent drugtargets, we sought to inhibit both viroporins as a means to curb infectivity. In a previous targeted study, we identified several blockers to each channel from anextensive drug repurposing library. Herein, we examined the ability of saidcompounds on the whole virus in cellulo. Gratifyingly, many of the blockersexhibited antiviral activity in a stringent assay examining protection fromviral-driven death. In particular, darapladib and flumatinib, both 3a blockers,displayed potent antiviral activity. Furthermore, appreciable synergism betweenflumatinib and several E blockers was identified in a concentration regime inwhich the compounds are present in human plasma following oral administration.Taken together, targeting ion channels represents a promising approach to bothaugment and complement our antiviral arsenal against COVID-19.

AB  - The merging of distinct computational approaches has become a powerful strategyfor discovering new biologically active compounds. By using molecular modeling,significant efforts have recently resulted in the development of new molecules,demonstrating high efficiency in reducing the replication of severe acuterespiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent responsible for the COVID-19pandemic. We have focused our interest on non-structural protein Nsp13(NTPase/helicase), as a crucial protein, embedded in thereplication-transcription complex (RTC), that controls the virus life cycle. Toassist in the identification of the most druggable surfaces of Nsps13, we applieda combination of four computational tools: FTMap, SiteMap, Fpocket andLigandScout. These software packages explored the binding sites for differentthree-dimensional structures of RTC complexes (PDB codes: 6XEZ, 7CXM, 7CXN),thus, detecting several hot spots, that were clustered to obtain ensembleconsensus sites, through a combination of four different approaches. Thecomparison of data provided new insights about putative druggable sites thatmight be employed for further docking simulations on druggable surfaces ofNsps13, in a scenario of repurposing drugs.

AB  - (1) Background: The WHO identified COVID-19 as a fast-growing epidemic worldwide.A few antivirals have shown promising effectiveness in treating COVID-19. Thisstudy aimed to assess the correlation between antiviral drugs and the time until viral clearance of SARS-CoV-2. (2) Methods: This was a retrospective cohort studythat included 1731 non-severe COVID-19 patients treated in NMC Royal Hospital,UAE. (3) Results: A total of 1446 patients received symptomatic treatment only(mean age of 35.6 +/- 9.0 years). The analyzed antiviral treatment protocols wereazithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and favipiravir. Theproduced Kaplan-Meier plots showed no significant differences in the time untilviral clearance among the compared protocols, which showed overlapping confidenceintervals, which were determined by performing the log-rank and adjusted pairwiselog-rank tests (p = 0.2, log-rank = 9.3). The age and gender of patients did not significantly affect the rate of viral clearance regardless of the antiviraltherapy administered, even when compared to patients who received symptomatictreatment only, with the exception of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin, andfavipiravir, which increased the odds of a faster rate of viral clearance by 46% after adjustments. (4) Conclusions: No significant differences were observedregarding the time until viral clearance among non-severe COVID-19 patientsfollowing the prescription of different antiviral drugs.

AB  - The development of new drugs is a very complex and time-consuming process, andfor this reason, researchers have been resorting heavily to drug repurposingtechniques as an alternative for the treatment of various diseases. This approachis especially interesting when it comes to emerging diseases with high rates ofinfection, because the lack of a quickly cure brings many human losses until the mitigation of the epidemic, as is the case of COVID-19. In this work, we combine an in-house developed machine learning strategy with docking, MM-PBSAcalculations, and metadynamics to detect potential inhibitors for SARS-COV-2 mainprotease among FDA approved compounds. To assess the ability of our machinelearning strategy to retrieve potential compounds we calculated the EnrichmentFactor of compound datasets for three well known protein targets: HIV-1 reversetranscriptase (PDB 4B3P), 5-HT2A serotonin receptor (PDB 6A94), and H1 histamine receptor (PDB 3RZE). The Enrichment Factor for each target was, respectively,102.5, 12.4, 10.6, which are considered significant values. Regarding theidentification of molecules that can potentially inhibit the main protease ofSARS-COV-2, compounds output by the machine learning step went through a docking experiment against SARS-COV-2 Mpro. The best scored poses were the input forMM-PBSA calculations and metadynamics using CHARMM and AMBER force fields topredict the binding energy for each complex. Our work points out six molecules,highlighting the strong interaction obtained for Mpro-mirabegron complex. Amongthese six, to the best of our knowledge, ambenonium has not yet been described inthe literature as a candidate inhibitor for the SARS-COV-2 main protease in itsactive pocket.

AB  - Corona virus is quickly spreading around the world. The goal of viral management is to disrupt the virus's life cycle, minimize lung damage, and alleviate severe symptoms. Numerous strategies have been used, including repurposing existingantivirals or drugs used in previous viral outbreaks. One such strategy is torepurpose FDA-approved kinase inhibitors that are potential chemotherapeuticagents and have demonstrated antiviral activity against a variety of viruses,including MERS, SARS-CoV-1, and others, by inhibiting the viral life cycle andthe inflammatory response associated with COVID-19. The purpose of this articleis to identify licensed kinase inhibitors that have the ability to reduce thevirus's life cycle, from entrance through viral propagation from cell to cell.Several of these inhibitors, including imatinib, ruxolitinib, silmitasertib, and tofacitinib (alone and in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine), are nowundergoing clinical studies to determine their efficacy as a possible treatmentdrug. The FDA approved baricitinib (a Janus kinase inhibitor) in combination withremdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 patients receiving hospital care inNovember 2020. While in vitro trials with gilteritinib, fedratinib, andosimertinib are encouraging, further research is necessary before theseinhibitors may be used to treat COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients treated with antivirals: a retrospectiveanalysis.
PG  - 11-12
AB  - Drug repurposing is considered as a rapid strategy for COVID-19 drug discoveryand many drugs have been tried for treatment of COVID-19. Antivirals likefavipiravir and remdesivir have become part of the COVID-19 Management Protocolby Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) as well as Maharashtra Stateguidelines since beginning, after being approved by Drugs Controller General ofIndia (DCGI). Although these drugs have shown promising results, their efficacyis still not proven completely and needs to be studied in large populations. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes in hospitalisedpatients with COVID-19 treated with remdesivir and/or favipiravir. MATERIAL:Retrospective analysis of medical records of 914 adult COVID-19 patientshospitalized in a tertiary care center in Mumbai was conducted. We assessed thefollowing outcomes: severity of disease, need for oxygen supplementation,incidence of complications, discharge from hospital or death, oxygen requirement at the time of discharge, duration of hospital stay. These outcomes were comparedbetween patients who received remdesivir only, patients who received favipiravir only, patients who received both remdesivir and favipiravir and patients who did not receive either remdesivir or favipiravir (control group). OBSERVATION: Oftotal 914 patients in our study, 55.79% patients received only remdesivir, 13.45%received only favipiravir, 7.76% received remdesivir plus favipiravir and 22.97% did not receive any antivirals. Higher number of patients in remdesivir onlygroup (60.19%) and remdesivir plus favipiravir groups (56.33%) requiredsupplemental oxygen [vs 32.38 % patients in control group and 24.39% infavipiravir only group]. Highest number of patients (91.05%) in favipiravir only group got discharged under Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelinesclosely followed by 88.73% in remdesivir plus favipiravir group, 88.43% inremdesivir only group and 82.38 % patients in control group. 8.43% patients inremdesivir only group, 6.5% in favipiravir only group, 7.04% in remdesivir plusfavipiravir group and 10.47 % patients in control group needed oxygen supportafter discharge. CONCLUSION: Majority of patients in our study got dischargedunder ICMR guidelines with higher proportion of patients in the treatment groups as compared to the control group. Also, lesser number of patients in thetreatment groups required oxygen supplementation post discharge as compared tothe control group.

TI  - D3AI-CoV: a deep learning platform for predicting drug targets and for virtualscreening against COVID-19.
LID - bbac147 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbac147 [doi]
AB  - Target prediction and virtual screening are two powerful tools of computer-aided drug design. Target identification is of great significance for hit discovery,lead optimization, drug repurposing and elucidation of the mechanism. Virtualscreening can improve the hit rate of drug screening to shorten the cycle of drugdiscovery and development. Therefore, target prediction and virtual screening areof great importance for developing highly effective drugs against COVID-19. Here we present D3AI-CoV, a platform for target prediction and virtual screening forthe discovery of anti-COVID-19 drugs. The platform is composed of three newlydeveloped deep learning-based models i.e., MultiDTI, MPNNs-CNN and MPNNs-CNN-Rmodels. To compare the predictive performance of D3AI-CoV with other methods, an external test set, named Test-78, was prepared, which consists of 39 newlypublished independent active compounds and 39 inactive compounds from DrugBank.For target prediction, the areas under the receiver operating characteristiccurves (AUCs) of MultiDTI and MPNNs-CNN models are 0.93 and 0.91, respectively,whereas the AUCs of the other reported approaches range from 0.51 to 0.74. Forvirtual screening, the hit rate of D3AI-CoV is also better than other methods.D3AI-CoV is available for free as a web application athttp://www.d3pharma.com/D3Targets-2019-nCoV/D3AI-CoV/index.php, which can serveas a rapid online tool for predicting potential targets for active compounds and for identifying active molecules against a specific target protein for COVID-19treatment.

TI  - Different HMGCR-inhibiting statins vary in their association with increasedsurvival in patients with COVID-19.

LID - 10.1101/2022.04.12.22273802 [doi]
AB  - Background: In response to the challenge to rapidly identify treatment optionsfor COVID-19, several studies reported that statins, as a drug class, reducemortality in these patients. Here we explored the possibility that differentstatins might differ in their ability to exert protective effects based oncomputational predictions. Methods: A Bayesian network tool was used to predictdrugs that shift the host transcriptomic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection towardsa healthy state. Drugs were predicted using 14 RNA-sequencing datasets from 72autopsy tissues and 465 COVID-19 patient samples or from cultured human cells andorganoids infected with SARS-CoV-2, with a total of 2,436 drugs investigated. Topdrug predictions included statins, which were tested in Vero E6 cells infectedwith SARS-CoV-2 and human endothelial cells infected with a related OC43coronavirus. A database containing over 4,000 COVID-19 patients on statins wasalso analyzed to determine mortality risk in patients prescribed specific statinsversus untreated matched controls. Findings: Simvastatin was among the mosthighly predicted compounds (14/14 datasets) and five other statins were predictedto be active in > 50% of analyses. In vitro testing of SARS- CoV-2 infected cellsrevealed simvastatin to be a potent inhibitor whereas most other statins wereless effective. Simvastatin also inhibited OC43 infection and reduced cytokineproduction in endothelial cells. Analysis of the clinical database revealed that reduced mortality risk was only observed in COVID-19 patients prescribed a subsetof statins, including simvastatin and atorvastatin. Interpretation: Differentstatins may differ in their ability to sustain the lives of COVID-19 patientsdespite having a shared target and lipid-modifying mechanism of action. Thesefindings highlight the value of target-agnostic drug prediction coupled withpatient databases to identify and validate non-obvious mechanisms and drugrepurposing opportunities.

AB  - Dexamethasone (DEX) has been widely used to treat a variety of diseases,including autoimmune diseases, allergies, ocular disorders, cancer, and, morerecently, COVID-19. However, DEX usage is often restricted in the clinic due toits poor water solubility. When administered through a systemic route, it canelicit severe side effects, such as hypertension, peptic ulcers, hyperglycemia,and hydro-electrolytic disorders. There is currently much interest in developing efficient DEX-loaded nanoformulations that ameliorate adverse disease effectsinhibiting advancements in scientific research. Various nanoparticles have beendeveloped to selectively deliver drugs without destroying healthy cells or organsin recent years. In the present review, we have summarized some of the mostattractive applications of DEX-loaded delivery systems, including liposomes,polymers, hydrogels, nanofibers, silica, calcium phosphate, and hydroxyapatite.This review provides our readers with a broad spectrum of nanomedicine approachesto deliver DEX safely.

AB  - Viruses can cause many diseases resulting in disabilities and death. Fortunately,advances in systems medicine enable the development of effective therapies fortreating viral diseases, of vaccines to prevent viral infections, as well as ofdiagnostic tools to mitigate the risk and reduce the death toll. Characterizingthe SARS-CoV-2 gene sequence and the role of its spike protein in infectioninforms development of small molecule drugs, antibodies, and vaccines to combatinfection and complication, as well as to end the pandemic. Drug repurposing ofsmall molecule drugs is a viable strategy to combat viral diseases; the keyconcepts include (1) linking a drug candidate's pharmacological network to itspharmacodynamic response in patients; (2) linking a drug candidate'sphysicochemical properties to its pharmacokinetic characteristics; and (3)optimizing the safe and effective dosing regimen within its therapeutic window.Computational integration of drug-induced signaling pathways with clinicaloutcomes is useful to inform selection of potential drug candidates with respect to safety and effectiveness. Key pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principlesfor computational optimization of drug development include a drug candidate'sCminss/IC95 ratio, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and systemicexposure-response relationship, where Cminss is the trough concentrationfollowing multiple dosing. In summary, systems medicine approaches play a vitalrole in global success in combating viral diseases, including global real-timeinformation sharing, development of test kits, drug repurposing, discovery anddevelopment of safe, effective therapies, detection of highly transmissible anddeadly variants, and development of vaccines.

AB  - Coronaviruses are the etiologic agents of several diseases. Coronaviruses ofcritical medical importance are characterized by highly inflammatorypathophysiology, involving severe pulmonary impairment and infection of multiple cell types within the body. Here, we discuss the interplay between coronaviruses and autophagy regarding virus life cycle, cell resistance, and inflammation,highlighting distinct mechanisms by which autophagy restrains inflammatoryresponses, especially those involved in coronavirus pathogenesis. We also addressdifferent autophagy modulators available and the rationale for drug repurposingas an attractive adjunctive therapy. We focused on pharmaceuticals being testedin clinical trials with distinct mechanisms but with autophagy as a commontarget. These autophagy modulators act in cell resistance to virus infection and immunomodulation, providing a double-strike to prevent or treat severe diseasedevelopment and death from coronaviruses diseases.

AB  - Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a zoonotic disease caused by a newsevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) which has quickly resulted in apandemic. Recent anti-COVID-19 drug discoveries are leaning towards repurposingphytochemicals which have been previously reported for SARS and MERS-CoVoutbreaks. However, they have been either virtually screened or tested so faragainst mono targets and the potent derivatives of virtually sorted leadmolecules remain elusive. We aimed to identify the phytochemicals havingpotentials to inhibit SARS CoV-2 infection via multiple targets. The selected 132phytochemicals were virtually screened using a structure based in silicotechnique against main protease (M(pro)) which is a potential target of SARSCoV-2. Six compounds were selected based on the LibDock scores and furthersubjected to induced fit docking using the CDOCKER module of DS. Two compoundsnamely cinnamtannin-B and gallocatechin gallate were identified as top HITSagainst main protease (M(pro)). Based on the Lipinski rule of five (L-ROF) andsynthetic feasibility, gallocatechin gallate was taken for our further studies.Six analogues of gallocatechin gallate were screened against the next importanttargets such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), angiotensin convertingenzyme-2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine -2 (TMPRSS2) and interleukin-6(IL-6) along with main protease (M(pro)). Our molecular docking results revealthat a gallocatechin analogue (GC-2) namely(2R,3R)-2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)chroman-3-yl-3,4,5-trihydroxy benzoate has shownpotential to inhibit multiple targets of SARS CoV-2. Further, the moleculardynamics study was carried out to ascertain the stability of the GC-2 and RdRpcomplex.

PG  - 10027-10042
LID - 10.1039/d0ra10674g [doi]
AB  - The global breakout of COVID-19 and raised death toll has prompted scientists to develop novel drugs capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. Conducting studies onrepurposing some FDA-approved glucocorticoids can be a promising prospective for finding a treatment for COVID-19. In addition, the use of anti-inflammatorydrugs, such as glucocorticoids, is a pivotal step in the treatment of criticalcases of COVID-19, as they can provoke an inflammatory cytokine storm, damaginglungs. In this study, 22 FDA-approved glucocorticoids were identified through in silico (molecular docking) studies as the potential inhibitors of COVID-19's mainprotease. From tested compounds, ciclesonide 11, dexamethasone 2, betamethasone1, hydrocortisone 4, fludrocortisone 3, and triamcinolone 8 are suggested as the most potent glucocorticoids active against COVID-19's main protease. Moreover,molecular dynamics simulations followed by the calculations of the binding freeenergy using MM-GBSA were carried out for the aforementioned promisingcandidate-screened glucocorticoids. In addition, quantum chemical calculationsrevealed two electron-rich sites on ciclesonide where binding interactions withthe main protease and cleavage of the prodrug to the active metabolite takeplace. Our results have ramifications for conducting preclinical and clinicalstudies on promising glucocorticoids to hasten the development of effectivetherapeutics against COVID-19. Another advantage is that some glucocorticoids canbe prioritized over others for the treatment of inflammation accompanyingCOVID-19.

AB  - Finding a potent inhibitor to the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 is indispensable nowadays. Currently, in-silico methods work as expeditious investigators to screen drugsfor possible repurposing or design new ones. Targeting one of the possibleSARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry receptors, Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), is an approach of major interest. Recently, GRP78 was reported as a recognizedrepresentative in recognition of the latest variants of SARS-CoV-2. In this work,molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the hostcell receptor GRP78. With its many terpenoid compounds, Chaga mushroom was testedas a potential therapeutic against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, GRP78. Resultsrevealed low binding energies (high affinities) toward the GRP78substrate-binding domain beta (SBDbeta) of Chaga mushroom terpenoids. Even thehighly specific cyclic peptide Pep42, which selectively targeted GRP78 overcancer cells in vivo, showed lower binding affinity against GRP78 SBDbetacompared to the binding affinities of terpenoids. These are auspicious resultsthat need to be tested experimentally. Intriguingly, terpenoids work as a double sword as they can be used to interfere with VUI 202,012/01, 501.V2, and B.1.1.248variants of SARS-CoV-2 spike recognition.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute RespiratorySyndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the largest pandemic in modernhistory with very high infection rates and considerable mortality. The disease,which emerged in China's Wuhan province, had its first reported case on December 29, 2019, and spread rapidly worldwide. On March 11, 2020, the World HealthOrganization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic and global healthemergency. Since the outbreak, efforts to develop COVID-19 vaccines, engineer newdrugs, and evaluate existing ones for drug repurposing have been intensivelyundertaken to find ways to control this pandemic. COVID-19 therapeutic strategiesaim to impair molecular pathways involved in the virus entrance and replicationor interfere in the patients' overreaction and immunopathology. Moreover,nanotechnology could be an approach to boost the activity of new drugs. SeveralCOVID-19 vaccine candidates have received emergency-use or full authorization in one or more countries, and others are being developed and tested. This reviewassesses the different strategies currently proposed to control COVID-19 and the issues or limitations imposed on some approaches by the human and viral geneticvariability.

TI  - Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling of nafamostat to support doseselection for treatment of pediatric patients with COVID-19.

AB  - Pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are increasing, andsevere cases such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome are being reported.Nafamostat, a repurposing drug, is currently being explored for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults. However, the data supporting its exposure in pediatricsremains scarce. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling enables theprediction of drug exposure in pediatrics based on ontogeny of metabolic enzymes and age dependent anatomical and physiological changes. The study aimed toestablish a PBPK model of nafamostat in adults, then scale the adult PBPK modelto children for predicting pediatric exposures of nafamostat and an optimalweight-based nafamostat dose in pediatric population. The developed modeladequately described adult exposure data in healthy volunteers following i.v.administration with three doses (10, 20, and 40 mg). Scaling adult PBPK models tofive pediatric groups predicted that as age advances from neonate to adult, theexposure of nafamostat slightly increased from neonate to infant, steadilydecreased from infant to child, and then increased from child to adult after the administration of 0.2 mg/kg/h for 14 days, a dosing regimen being conducted in a clinical trial for COVID-19. Based on the fold change of predicted area under thecurve for the respective pediatric group over those of adults, weight-baseddosages for each pediatric group may be suggested. The novel PBPK model describedin this study may be useful to investigate nafamostat pharmacokinetics in apediatric subgroup further.

TI  - In Silico Drug Repositioning to Target the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease as CovalentInhibitors Employing a Combined Structure-Based Virtual Screening Strategy ofPharmacophore Models and Covalent Docking.
LID - 3987 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23073987 [doi]
AB  - The epidemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which has spread rapidlythroughout the world, requires urgent and effective treatments considering thatthe appearance of viral variants limits the efficacy of vaccines. The mainprotease of SARS-CoV-2 (M(pro)) is a highly conserved cysteine proteinase,fundamental for the replication of the coronavirus and with a specific cleavagemechanism that positions it as an attractive therapeutic target for the proposal of irreversible inhibitors. A structure-based strategy combining 3Dpharmacophoric modeling, virtual screening, and covalent docking was employed to identify the interactions required for molecular recognition, as well as thespatial orientation of the electrophilic warhead, of various drugs, to achieve a covalent interaction with Cys145 of M(pro). The virtual screening on thestructure-based pharmacophoric map of the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) in complex with aninhibitor N3 (reference compound) provided high efficiency by identifying 53drugs (FDA and DrugBank databases) with probabilities of covalent binding,including N3 (Michael acceptor) and others with a variety of electrophilicwarheads. Adding the energy contributions of affinity for non-covalent andcovalent docking, 16 promising drugs were obtained. Our findings suggest that theFDA-approved drugs Vaborbactam, Cimetidine, Ixazomib, Scopolamine, andBicalutamide, as well as the other investigational peptide-like drugs (DB04234,DB03456, DB07224, DB7252, and CMX-2043) are potential covalent inhibitors ofSARS-CoV-2 M(pro).

AB  - Mapping non-canonical cellular pathways affected by approved medications canaccelerate drug repurposing efforts, which are crucial in situations with aglobal impact such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Fluoxetine and fluvoxamine arewell-established and widely-used antidepressive agents that act as serotoninreuptake inhibitors (SSRI-s). Interestingly, these drugs have been reportedearlier to act as lysosomotropic agents, inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase inthe lysosomes, and as ligands of sigma-1 receptors, mechanisms that might be usedto fight severe outcomes of COVID-19. In certain cases, these drugs wereadministered for selected COVID-19 patients because of their antidepressiveeffects, while in other cases, clinical studies were performed to assess theeffect of these drugs on treating COVID-19 patients. Clinical studies producedpromising data that encourage the further investigation of fluoxetine andfluvoxamine regarding their use in COVID-19. In this review, we summarizeexperimental data and the results of the performed clinical studies. We alsoprovide an overview of previous knowledge on the tissue distribution of thesedrugs and by integrating this information with the published experimentalresults, we highlight the real opportunity of using these drugs in our fightagainst COVID-19.

TI  - Repurposing Multiple-Molecule Drugs for COVID-19-Associated Acute RespiratoryDistress Syndrome and Non-Viral Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome via a SystemsBiology Approach and a DNN-DTI Model Based on Five Drug Design Specifications.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is currently raging around theworld at a rapid speed. Among COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2-associated acuterespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the main contribution to the high ratioof morbidity and mortality. However, clinical manifestations betweenSARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS and non-SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS are quite common,and their therapeutic treatments are limited because the intricatedpathophysiology having been not fully understood. In this study, to investigatethe pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS andnon-SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS, first, we constructed a candidate host-pathogeninterspecies genome-wide genetic and epigenetic network (HPI-GWGEN) via database mining. With the help of host-pathogen RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data, realHPI-GWGEN of COVID-19-associated ARDS and non-viral ARDS were obtained by system modeling, system identification, and Akaike information criterion (AIC) modelorder selection method to delete the false positives in candidate HPI-GWGEN. For the convenience of mitigation, the principal network projection (PNP) approach isutilized to extract core HPI-GWGEN, and then the corresponding core signalingpathways of COVID-19-associated ARDS and non-viral ARDS are annotated via theircore HPI-GWGEN by KEGG pathways. In order to design multiple-molecule drugs ofCOVID-19-associated ARDS and non-viral ARDS, we identified essential biomarkersas drug targets of pathogenesis by comparing the core signal pathways betweenCOVID-19-associated ARDS and non-viral ARDS. The deep neural network of thedrug-target interaction (DNN-DTI) model could be trained by drug-targetinteraction databases in advance to predict candidate drugs for the identifiedbiomarkers. We further narrowed down these predicted drug candidates to repurposepotential multiple-molecule drugs by the filters of drug design specifications,including regulation ability, sensitivity, excretion, toxicity, anddrug-likeness. Taken together, we not only enlighten the etiologic mechanismsunder COVID-19-associated ARDS and non-viral ARDS but also provide noveltherapeutic options for COVID-19-associated ARDS and non-viral ARDS.

TI  - Computational drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 reveals plasma membranecholesterol depletion as key factor of antiviral drug activity.
PG  - e1010021
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010021 [doi]
AB  - Comparing SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced gene expression signatures to drugtreatment-induced gene expression signatures is a promising bioinformatic tool torepurpose existing drugs against SARS-CoV-2. The general hypothesis ofsignature-based drug repurposing is that drugs with inverse similarity to adisease signature can reverse disease phenotype and thus be effective against it.However, in the case of viral infection diseases, like SARS-CoV-2, infected cellsalso activate adaptive, antiviral pathways, so that the relationship betweeneffective drug and disease signature can be more ambiguous. To address thisquestion, we analysed gene expression data from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected celllines, and gene expression signatures of drugs showing anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Our extensive functional genomic analysis showed that both infection andtreatment with in vitro effective drugs leads to activation of antiviral pathwayslike NFkB and JAK-STAT. Based on the similarity-and not inversesimilarity-between drug and infection-induced gene expression signatures, we wereable to predict the in vitro antiviral activity of drugs. We also identifiedSREBF1/2, key regulators of lipid metabolising enzymes, as the most activatedtranscription factors by several in vitro effective antiviral drugs. Using afluorescently labeled cholesterol sensor, we showed that these drugs decrease thecholesterol levels of plasma-membrane. Supplementing drug-treated cells withcholesterol reversed the in vitro antiviral effect, suggesting the depletingplasma-membrane cholesterol plays a key role in virus inhibitory mechanism. Ourresults can help to more effectively repurpose approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2,and also highlights key mechanisms behind their antiviral effect.

PG  - 1988-1997
LID - 10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00222 [doi]
AB  - The cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as an attractive drug developmenttarget. We previously reported that the entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the cellsurface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and the cortex actin, which can betargeted by therapeutic agents identified by conventional drug repurposingscreens. However, this drug identification strategy requires laborious libraryscreening, which is time consuming, and often limited number of compounds can be screened. As an alternative approach, we developed and trained a graphconvolutional network (GCN)-based classification model using informationextracted from experimentally identified HSPG and actin inhibitors. This methodallowed us to virtually screen 170,000 compounds, resulting in approximately 2000potential hits. A hit confirmation assay with the uptake of a fluorescentlylabeled HSPG cargo further shortlisted 256 active compounds. Among them, 16compounds had modest to strong inhibitory activities against the entry ofSARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped particles into Vero E6 cells. These results establish aGCN-based virtual screen workflow for rapid identification of new small molecule inhibitors against validated drug targets.

PG  - 1022-1030
LID - 10.1021/acsinfecdis.1c00629 [doi]
AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic underscores the dire need for effective antivirals. Encouraging progress has been made in developing small-molecule inhibitorstargeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and main protease(M(pro)). However, the development of papain-like protease (PL(pro)) inhibitorsfaces several obstacles. Nevertheless, PL(pro) represents a high-profile drugtarget given its multifaceted roles in viral replication. PL(pro) is involved in not only the cleavage of viral polyprotein but also the modulation of host immuneresponse. In this study, we conducted a drug-repurposing screening of PL(pro)against the MedChemExpress bioactive compound library and identified three hits, EACC, KY-226, and tropifexor, as potent PL(pro) inhibitors with IC50 valuesranging from 3.39 to 8.28 muM. The three hits showed dose-dependent binding toPL(pro) in the thermal shift assay. In addition, tropifexor inhibited thecellular PL(pro) activity in the FlipGFP assay with an IC50 of 10.6 muM.Gratifyingly, tropifexor showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3cells at noncytotoxic concentrations. Overall, tropifexor represents a novelPL(pro) inhibitor that can be further developed as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals.

AB  - Conventional drug screening methods search for a limited number of smallmolecules that directly interact with the target protein. This process can beslow, cumbersome and has driven the need for developing new drug screeningapproaches to counter rapidly emerging diseases such as COVID-19. We propose apipeline for drug repurposing combining in silico drug candidate identificationfollowed by in vitro characterization of these candidates. We first identified a gene target of interest, the entry receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Next, we employed a gene expression profile database,L1000-based Connectivity Map to query gene expression patterns in lung epithelialcells, which act as the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using geneexpression profiles from 5 different lung epithelial cell lines, wecomputationally identified 17 small molecules that were predicted to decreaseACE2 expression. We further performed a streamlined validation in the normalhuman epithelial cell line BEAS-2B to demonstrate that these compounds can indeeddecrease ACE2 surface expression and to profile cell health and viability upondrug treatment. This proposed pipeline combining in silico drug compoundidentification and in vitro expression and viability characterization in relevantcell types can aid in the repurposing of FDA-approved drugs to combat rapidlyemerging diseases.

AB  - Drug repositioning continues to be the most effective, practicable possibility totreat COVID-19 patients. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) virus enters target cells by binding to the ACE2 receptor via itsspike (S) glycoprotein. We used molecular docking-based virtual screeningapproaches to categorize potential antagonists, halting ACE2-spike interactionsby utilizing 450 FDA-approved chemical compounds. Three drug candidates (i.e.,anidulafungin, lopinavir, and indinavir) were selected, which show high bindingaffinity toward the ACE2 receptor. The conformational stability of selecteddocked complexes was analyzed through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The MDsimulation trajectories were assessed and monitored for ACE2 deviation, residuefluctuation, the radius of gyration, solvent accessible surface area, and freeenergy landscapes. The inhibitory activities of the selected compounds wereeventually tested in-vitro using Vero and HEK-ACE2 cells. Interestingly, besides inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein induced syncytia formation, anidulafunginand lopinavir also blocked S-pseudotyped particle entry into target cells.Altogether, anidulafungin and lopinavir are ranked the most effective among allthe tested drugs against ACE2 receptor-S glycoprotein interaction. Based on thesefindings, we propose that anidulafungin is a novel potential drug targeting ACE2,which warrants further investigation for COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - Drug repurposing is an appealing method to address the Coronavirus 2019(COVID-19) pandemic because of the low cost and efficiency. We analyzed ourin-house database of approved drug screens and compared their activity profileswith results from a severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cytopathic effect (CPE) assay. The activity profiles of the humanether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG), phospholipidosis (PLD), and many cytotoxicity screens were found significantly correlated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. hERGinhibition is a nonspecific off-target effect that has contributed to promiscuousdrug interactions, whereas drug-induced PLD is an undesirable effect linked tohERG blockers. Thus, this study identifies preferred drug candidates as well aschemical structures that should be avoided because of their potential to inducetoxicity. Lastly, we highlight the hERG liability of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugscurrently enrolled in clinical trials.

AB  - This study formulates antiviral repositioning as a matrix completion problemwherein the antiviral drugs are along the rows and the viruses are along thecolumns. The input matrix is partially filled, with ones in positions where theantiviral drug has been known to be effective against a virus. The curatedmetadata for antivirals (chemical structure and pathways) and viruses (genomicstructure and symptoms) are encoded into our matrix completion framework as graphLaplacian regularization. We then frame the resulting multiple graph regularized matrix completion (GRMC) problem as deep matrix factorization. This is solved by using a novel optimization method called HyPALM (Hybrid Proximal AlternatingLinearized Minimization). Results of our curated RNA drug-virus association data set show that the proposed approach excels over state-of-the-art GRMC techniques.When applied to in silico prediction of antivirals for COVID-19, our approachreturns antivirals that are either used for treating patients or are under trialsfor the same.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that ivermectin (IVM) exhibits antiviralactivity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),the causative virus of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, therepurposing of IVM for the treatment of COVID-19 has presented challengesprimarily due to the low IVM plasma concentration after oral administration,which was well below IC50. Here, a red blood cell (RBC)-hitchhiking strategy was used for the targeted delivery of IVM-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) to the lung.IVM-loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs (IVM-PNPs) andchitosan-coating IVM-PNPs (IVM-CSPNPs) were prepared and adsorbed onto RBCs. BothRBC-hitchhiked IVM-PNPs and IVM-CSPNPs could significantly enhance IVM deliveryto lungs, improve IVM accumulation in lung tissue, inhibit the inflammatoryresponses and finally significantly alleviate the progression of acute lunginjury. Specifically, the redistribution and circulation effects were related to the properties of NPs. RBC-hitchhiked cationic IVM-CSPNPs showed a longercirculation time, slower accumulation and elimination rates, and higheranti-inflammatory activities than RBC-hitchhiked anionic IVM-PNPs. Therefore,RBC-hitchhiking provides an alternative strategy to improve IVM pharmacokinetics and bioavailability for repurposing of IVM to treat COVID-19. Furthermore,according to different redistribution effects of different NPs, RBC-hitchhikedNPs may achieve various accumulation rates and circulation times for differentrequirements of drug delivery.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is one of the mostsevere global pandemic due to its high pathogenicity and death rate starting fromthe end of 2019. Though there are some vaccines available against SAER-CoV-2infections, we are worried about their effectiveness, due to its unstablesequence patterns. Therefore, beside vaccines, globally effective supportingdrugs are also required for the treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Toexplore commonly effective repurposable drugs for the treatment against differentvariants of coronavirus infections, in this article, an attempt was made toexplore host genomic biomarkers guided repurposable drugs for SARS-CoV-1infections and their validation with SARS-CoV-2 infections by using theintegrated bioinformatics approaches. At first, we identified 138 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between SARS-CoV-1 infected and control samples byanalyzing high throughput gene-expression profiles to select drug target keyreceptors. Then we identified top-ranked 11 key DEGs (SMAD4, GSK3B, SIRT1, ATM,RIPK1, PRKACB, MED17, CCT2, BIRC3, ETS1 and TXN) as hub genes (HubGs) byprotein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of DEGs highlighting theirfunctions, pathways, regulators and linkage with other disease risks that mayinfluence SARS-CoV-1 infections. The DEGs-set enrichment analysis significantlydetected some crucial biological processes (immune response, regulation ofangiogenesis, apoptotic process, cytokine production and programmed cell death,response to hypoxia and oxidative stress), molecular functions (transcriptionfactor binding and oxidoreductase activity) and pathways (transcriptionalmis-regulation in cancer, pathways in cancer, chemokine signaling pathway) thatare associated with SARS-CoV-1 infections as well as SARS-CoV-2 infections byinvolving HubGs. The gene regulatory network (GRN) analysis detected sometranscription factors (FOXC1, GATA2, YY1, FOXL1, TP53 and SRF) and micro-RNAs(hsa-mir-92a-3p, hsa-mir-155-5p, hsa-mir-106b-5p, hsa-mir-34a-5p andhsa-mir-19b-3p) as the key transcriptional and post- transcriptional regulatorsof HubGs, respectively. We also detected some chemicals (Valproic Acid,Cyclosporine, Copper Sulfate and arsenic trioxide) that may regulates HubGs. The disease-HubGs interaction analysis showed that our predicted HubGs are alsoassociated with several other diseases including different types of lungdiseases. Then we considered 11 HubGs mediated proteins and their regulatory 6key TFs proteins as the drug target proteins (receptors) and performed theirdocking analysis with the SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease-guided top listed 90 anti-viraldrugs out of 3410. We found Rapamycin, Tacrolimus, Torin-2, Radotinib,Danoprevir, Ivermectin and Daclatasvir as the top-ranked 7 candidate-drugs withrespect to our proposed target proteins for the treatment against SARS-CoV-1infections. Then, we validated these 7 candidate-drugs against the alreadypublished top-ranked 11 target proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections by molecular docking simulation and found their significant binding affinity scores with our proposed candidate-drugs. Finally, we validated all of our findings bythe literature review. Therefore, the proposed candidate-drugs might play a vitalrole for the treatment against different variants of SARS-CoV-2 infections withcomorbidities, since the proposed HubGs are also associated with severalcomorbidities.

TI  - Molecular insights to the binding interactions of APNS containing HIV-proteaseinhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro): an in silico approach towards drugrepurposing.
PG  - 1-14
LID - 10.1080/07391102.2022.2059008 [doi]
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) is one of the most vital enzymes of the new coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2) and is a crucial target for drug discovery. Unfortunately, there is not any potential drugs available to combat the action of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro).Based on the reports HIV-protease inhibitors can be applied against the SARS bytargeting the SARS-CoV-1 M(pro), we have chosen few clinically trialedexperimental and allophenylnorstatine (APNS) containing HIV-protease inhibitors(JE-2147, JE-533, KNI-227, KNI-272 & KNI-1931), to examine their bindingaffinities with SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and to assess their potential to check for apossible drug candidate against the protease. Here, we have chosen a methodology to understand the binding mechanism of these five inhibitors to SARS-CoV-2 M(pro)by merging molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and MM-PBSAbased free energy calculations. Our estimations disclose that JE-2147 is highlyeffective (DeltaGBind = -28.31 kcal/mol) due to an increased favorable van derWaals (DeltaEvdw) interactions and decreased solvation (DeltaGsolv) energiesbetween the inhibitor and viral protease. JE-2147 shows a higher level ofinteractions as compared to JE-533 (-6.85 kcal/mol), KNI-227 (-18.36 kcal/mol),KNI-272 (-15.69 kcal/mol) and KNI-1931 (-21.59 kcal/mol) against SARS-CoV-2M(pro). Binding contributions of important residues (His41, Met49, Cys145,His164, Met165, Glu166, Pro168, Gln189, etc.) from the active site or near theactive site regions with >/=1.0 kcal/mol suggest a potent binding of theinhibitors. It is anticipated that the current study of binding interactions ofthese APNS containing inhibitors can pitch some valuable insights to design thesignificantly effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) drugs.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.Sarma.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causalagent of the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 274 million individuals have sufferedfrom COVID-19 and over five million people have died from this disease so far.Therefore, there is an urgent need for therapeutic drugs. Repurposing FDAapproved drugs should be favored since evaluation of safety and efficacy ofde-novo drug design are both costly and time consuming. We report that imatinib, an Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, robustly decreases SARS-CoV-2 infection anduncover a mechanism of action. We show that imatinib inhibits the infection ofSARS-CoV-2 and its surrogate lentivector pseudotype. In latter, imatinibinhibited both routes of viral entry, endocytosis and membrane-fusion. Weutilized a system to quantify in real-time cell-cell membrane fusion mediated by the SARS-CoV-2 surface protein, Spike, and its receptor, hACE2, to demonstratethat imatinib inhibits this process in an Abl1 and Abl2 independent manner.Furthermore, cellular thermal shift assay revealed a direct imatinib-Spikeinteraction that affects Spike susceptibility to trypsin digest. Collectively,our data suggest that imatinib inhibits Spike mediated viral entry by anoff-target mechanism. These findings mark imatinib as a promising therapeuticdrug in inhibiting the early steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

LID - 10.1177/03000605221090363 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been used during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic because of its reported anti-viral activity. This study examined the association of chronic HCQ use with the incidence and complications of COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adults withrheumatoid arthritis and/or systemic lupus erythematosus who visited rheumatologyclinics in three tertiary hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia between January 2019 and December 2020. Patients were categorized into two groups based on HCQ use.Data were obtained from the electronic health record and by interviews withpatients. The primary study objective was the incidence of COVID-19 and itscomplications from March 2020 to February 2021. RESULTS: Almost 11% of the study cohort was positive for COVID-19, and the incidence of COVID-19 was similarbetween HCQ users (11.11%) and nonusers (10.86%). Disease complication rates weresimilar in the study arms, and they mainly included fever, dry cough, fatigue,and breathing difficulty. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed no significantassociation between chronic HCQ use and the incidence of COVID-19, and diseasecomplications were similar in the study arms.

AB  - Background: In the last two decades, the world has witnessed the emergence ofzoonotic corona viruses (CoVs), which cause mild to severe respiratory diseasesin humans. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), mainly from the alpha-CoV and beta-CoVgenera, have evolved to be highly pathogenic, such as SARS-CoV-2 causing theCOVID-19 pandemic. These coronaviruses carry functional enzymes necessary for thevirus life cycle, which represent attractive antiviral targets. Methods &Results: We aimed to therapeutically target the main protease (Mpro) of HCoV-NL63and HCoV-229E (from alpha-CoV genus) and HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 (from beta-CoV genus). Through virtual screening, we identified an FDA-approved drug dyphylline,a xanthine derivate, that binds to the catalytic dyad residues; histidine andcystine of the Mpro structures. Importantly, dyphylline dose-dependentlyinhibited the viral replication in cell culture models infected with the viruses.Conclusion: Our findings support the repurposing of dyphylline as apan-coronavirus antiviral agent.

AB  - The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 triggering the COVID-19 pandemic ranks as arguablythe greatest medical emergency of the last century. COVID-19 has highlightedhealth disparities both within and between countries and will leave a lastingimpact on global society. Nonetheless, substantial investment in life sciencesover recent decades has facilitated a rapid scientific response with innovations in viral characterization, testing, and sequencing. Perhaps most remarkably, thispermitted the development of highly effective vaccines, which are beingdistributed globally at unprecedented speed. In contrast, drug treatments for theestablished disease have delivered limited benefits so far. Innovative and rapid approaches in the design and execution of large-scale clinical trials andrepurposing of existing drugs have saved many lives; however, many more remain atrisk. In this review we describe challenges and unmet needs, discuss existingtherapeutics, and address future opportunities. Consideration is given to factorsthat have hindered drug development in order to support planning for the nextpandemic challenge and to allow rapid and cost-effective development of newtherapeutics with equitable delivery.

AB  - The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)with the most contagious variants, alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), delta(B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529) has continuously added a higher number ofmorbidity and mortality, globally. The present integratedbioinformatics-cheminformatics approach was employed to locate potent antiviralmarine alkaloids that could be used against SARS-CoV-2. Initially, 57 antiviralmarine alkaloids and two repurposing drugs were selected from an extensiveliterature review. Then, the putative target enzyme SARS-CoV-2 main protease(SARS-CoV-2-Mpro) was retrieved from the protein data bank and carried out avirtual screening-cum-molecular docking study with all candidates using PyRx 0.8 and AutoDock 4.2 software. Further, the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of thetwo most potential alkaloids and a drug docking complex at 100 ns (with twoligand topology files from PRODRG and ATB server, separately), the molecularmechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) free energy, and contributionsof entropy were investigated. Then, thephysicochemical-toxicity-pharmacokinetics-drug-likeness profiles, the frontiermolecular orbitals energies (highest occupied molecular orbital, lowestunoccupied molecular orbital, and DeltaE), and structural-activity relationshipwere assessed and analyzed. Based on binding energy, 8-hydroxymanzamine (-10.5kcal/mol) and manzamine A (-10.1 kcal/mol) from all alkaloids with darunavir(-7.9 kcal/mol) and lopinavir (-7.4 kcal/mol) against SARS-CoV-2-Mpro wererecorded. The MD simulation (RMSD, RMSF, Rg, H-bond, MM/PBSA binding energy)illustrated that the 8-hydroxymanzamine exhibits a static thermodynamic featurethan the other two complexes. The predicted physicochemical, toxicity,pharmacokinetics, and drug-likeness profiles also revealed that the8-hydroxymanzamine could be used as a potential lead candidate individuallyand/or synergistically with darunavir or lopinavir to combat SARS-CoV-2 infectionafter some pharmacological validation.

PG  - 125-137
AB  - Background and Aim: The present study intends to investigate COVID-19 bytargeting their main proteins with 17 selected drugs used for treating OralLichen Planus (OLP) which is a chronic muco-cutaneous disorder. Here, an attempt is made to gain better insight into the structure of various drugs targetingspecific proteins which will be helpful in developing drugs useful fortherapeutic and preventive measures. Method: In silico studies, molecular dockingand molecular dynamic simulations were performed to repurpose the therapeuticdrugs (n = 17) which were used to treat OLP against COVID-19. In addition, themaximum binding affinities of the key protein spike glycoprotein, main-protease(M(pro)) of coronavirus, and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) in the humanbody were evaluated with the selected drugs. Results: Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) showed the highest docking values among the drugs selected forrepurposing. Among the target proteins, EGCG has shown maximum binding affinitywith ACE-2 receptor. Further, according to the molecular dynamic simulationstudies, EGCG has shown the least conformational fluctuations with M(pro).Conclusion: EGCG can be a potential inhibitor drug which can bind with ACE-2receptor thus inhibiting the interaction of mainly M(pro) protein and spikeglycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Relevance for Patients: EGCG, a natural compoundshows antiviral potential having considerably high affinity and stability withSARS-CoV-2. It might be further employed as a lead drug against selectiveinhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 for the therapeutic management of COVID-19 patientsafter necessary clinical trials.

PG  - 212-226
LID - 10.1007/s40495-022-00285-w [doi]
AB  - Purpose of Review: This article provides a review of the recent literaturerelated to the FDA-approved drugs that had been repurposed as potential drugcandidates against COVID-19. Moreover, we performed a quality pharmacophore studyfor frequently studied targets, namely, the main protease, RNA-dependent RNApolymerase, and spike protein. Recent Findings: Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic,the whole spectrum of scientific community is still unable to invent an absolute therapeutic agent for COVID-19. Considering such a fact, drug repurposingstrategies seem a truly viable approach to develop novel therapeuticinterventions. Summery: Drug repurposing explores previously approved drugs ofknown safety and pharmacokinetics profile for possible new effects, reducing the cost, time, and predicting prospective side effects and drug interactions.COVID-19 virulent machinery appeared similar to other viruses, making antiviralagents widely repurposed in pursuit for curative candidates. Our main proteasepharmacophoric study revealed multiple features and could be a probable starting point for upcoming research.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic spurred a broad interest in antiviral drug discovery. TheSARS-CoV-2 main protease (M (pro) ) and papain-like protease (PL (pro) ) areattractive antiviral drug targets given their vital roles in viral replicationand modulation of host immune response. Structurally disparate compounds werereported as M (pro) and PL (pro) inhibitors from either drug repurposing orrational design. Two polyphenols dieckol and 1,2,3,4,6-pentagalloylglucose (PGG) were recently reported as SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M (pro) ) inhibitors. Withour continuous interest in studying the mechanism of inhibition and resistance ofM (pro) inhibitors, we report herein our independent validation/invalidation ofthese two natural products. Our FRET-based enzymatic assay showed that neitherdieckol nor PGG inhibited SARS-CoV-2 M (pro) (IC 50 > 20 microM), which is incontrary to previous reports. Serendipitously, PGG was found to inhibit theSARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PL (pro) ) with an IC 50 of 3.90 microM. Thebinding of PGG to PL (pro) was further confirmed in the thermal shift assay.However, PGG was cytotoxic in 293T-ACE2 cells (CC 50 = 7.7 microM), so itsintracellular PL (pro) inhibitory activity could not be quantified by thecell-based Flip-GFP PL (pro) assay. In addition, we also invalidated ebselen,disulfiram, carmofur, PX12, and tideglusib as SARS-CoV-2 PL (pro) inhibitorsusing the Flip-GFP assay. Overall, our results call for stringent hit validation,and the serendipitous discovery of PGG as a putative PL (pro) inhibitor mightworth further pursuing.

AB  - We present a cell-free assay for rapid screening of candidate inhibitors ofprotein binding, focusing on inhibition of the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(hACE2). The assay has two components: fluorescent polystyrene particlescovalently coated with RBD, termed virion-particles (v-particles), andfluorescently labeled hACE2 (hACE2F) that binds the v-particles. When incubatedwith an inhibitor, v-particle-hACE2F binding is diminished, resulting in areduction in the fluorescent signal of bound hACE2F relative to the noninhibitor control, which can be measured via flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy. We determine the amount of RBD needed for v-particle preparation, v-particleincubation time with hACE2F, hACE2F detection limit, and specificity ofv-particle binding to hACE2F. We measure the dose response of the v-particles to known inhibitors. Finally, utilizing an RNA-binding protein tdPP7 incorporatedinto hACE2F, we demonstrate that RNA-hACE2F granules trap v-particleseffectively, providing a basis for potential RNA-hACE2F therapeutics.

AB  - The ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 has killed morethan 5.9 million individuals out of approximately 43 million confirmedinfections. At present, several parts of the world are encountering the 3rd wave.Mass vaccination has been started in several countries but they are less likelyto be broadly available for the current pandemic, repurposing of the existingdrugs has drawn highest attention for an immediate solution. A recent publicationhas mapped the physical interactions of SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins byaffinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and identified 332high-confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Here, wetaken a network biology approach and constructed a human protein-proteininteraction network (PPIN) with the above SARS-CoV-2 targeted proteins. Weutilized a combination of essential network centrality measures and functionalproperties of the human proteins to identify the critical human targets ofSARS-CoV-2. Four human proteins, namely PRKACA, RHOA, CDK5RAP2, and CEP250 haveemerged as the best therapeutic targets, of which PRKACA and CEP250 were alsofound by another group as potential candidates for drug targets in COVID-19. Wefurther found candidate drugs/compounds, such as guanosine triphosphate,remdesivir, adenosine monophosphate, MgATP, and H-89 dihydrochloride that bindthe target human proteins. The urgency to prevent the spread of infection and thedeath of diseased individuals has prompted the search for agents from the pool ofapproved drugs to repurpose them for COVID-19. Our results indicate that hosttargeting therapy with the repurposed drugs may be a useful strategy for thetreatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

PG  - 755745
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.755745 [doi]
AB  - Background: COVID-19 treatment remains a challenge for medicine because of theextremely short time for clinical studies of drug candidates, so the drugrepurposing strategy, which implies the use of well-known and safe substances, isa promising approach. Objective: We present the results of an observationalclinical study that focused on the influence of riboflavin (vitamin B2)supplementation on the immune markers of COVID-19 severity in patients withmental health disorders. Results: We have found that 10 mg of flavinmononucleotide (a soluble form of riboflavin) intramuscularly twice a day within 7 days correlated with the normalization of clinically relevant immune markers(neutrophils and lymphocytes counts, as well as their ratio) in COVID-19patients. Additionally, we demonstrated that total leucocytes, neutrophils, andlymphocytes counts, as well as the neutrophils to leucocytes ratio (NLR),correlated with the severity of the disease. We also found that patients withorganic disorders (F0 in ICD-10) demonstrated higher inflammation then patientswith schizophrenia (F2 in ICD-10). Conclusion: We suggest that riboflavinsupplementation could be promising for decreasing inflammation in COVID-19, andfurther evaluation is required. This observational clinical trial has beenregistered by the Sverzhevsky Research Institute of Clinical Otorhinolaryngology (Moscow, Russia), Protocol No. 4 dated 05/27/2020.

LID - 10.2217/fvl-2021-0160 [doi]
AB  - Novel COVID-19 is a public health emergency that poses a serious threat to peopleworldwide. Given the virus spreading so quickly, novel antiviral medications are desperately needed. Repurposing existing drugs is the first strategy.Anti-parasitic drugs were among the first to be considered as a potentialtreatment option for this disease. Even though many papers have discussed theefficacy of various anti-parasitic drugs in treating COVID-19 separately, so far,no single study comprehensively discussed these drugs. This study reviews someanti-parasitic recommended drugs to treat COVID-19, in terms of function and invitro as well as clinical results. Finally, we briefly review the advancedtechniques, such as artificial intelligence, that have been used to findeffective drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - We urgently need to identify drugs to treat patients suffering from COVID-19infection. Drugs rarely act at single molecular targets. Off-target effects areresponsible for undesirable side effects and beneficial synergy between targetsfor specific illnesses. They have provided blockbuster drugs, e.g., Viagra forerectile dysfunction and Minoxidil for male pattern baldness. Existing drugs,those in clinical trials, and approved natural products constitute a richresource of therapeutic agents that can be quickly repurposed, as they havealready been assessed for safety in man. A key question is how to screen suchcompounds rapidly and efficiently for activity against new pandemic pathogenssuch as SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show how a fast and robust computational process canbe used to screen large libraries of drugs and natural compounds to identifythose that may inhibit the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. We show that theshortlist of 84 candidates with the strongest predicted binding affinities ishighly enriched (>/=25%) in compounds experimentally validated in vivo or invitro to have activity in SARS-CoV-2. The top candidates also include drugs andnatural products not previously identified as having COVID-19 activity, therebyproviding leads for experimental validation. This predictive in silico screening pipeline will be valuable for repurposing existing drugs and discovering new drugcandidates against other medically important pathogens relevant to futurepandemics.

AB  - Vaccines have reduced the transmission and severity of COVID-19, but thereremains a paucity of efficacious treatment for drug-resistant strains and moresusceptible individuals, particularly those who mount a suboptimal vaccineresponse, either due to underlying health conditions or concomitant therapies.Repurposing existing drugs is a timely, safe and scientifically robust method fortreating pandemics, such as COVID-19. Here, we review the pharmacology andscientific rationale for repurposing niclosamide, an anti-helminth already inhuman use as a treatment for COVID-19. In addition, its potent antiviralactivity, niclosamide has shown pleiotropic anti-inflammatory, antibacterial,bronchodilatory and anticancer effects in numerous preclinical and early clinicalstudies. The advantages and rationale for nebulized and intranasal formulationsof niclosamide, which target the site of the primary infection in COVID-19, arereviewed. Finally, we give an overview of ongoing clinical trials investigatingniclosamide as a promising candidate against SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Drug repositioning of COVID-19 based on mixed graph network and ion channel.
PG  - 3269-3284
LID - 10.3934/mbe.2022151 [doi]
AB  - Research on the relationship between drugs and targets is the key to precisionmedicine. Ion channel is a kind of important drug targets. Aiming at the urgentneeds of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment and drug development,this paper designed a mixed graph network model to predict the affinity betweenion channel targets of COVID-19 and drugs. According to the simplified molecular input line entry specification (SMILES) code of drugs, firstly, the atomicfeatures were extracted to construct the point sets, and edge sets wereconstructed according to atomic bonds. Then the undirected graph with atomicfeatures was generated by RDKit tool and the graph attention layer was used toextract the drug feature information. Five ion channel target proteins werescreened from the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences of NCBI database, and theprotein features were extracted by convolution neural network (CNN). Usingattention mechanism and graph convolutional network (GCN), the extracted drugfeatures and target features information were connected. After two fullconnection layers operation, the drug-target affinity was output, and model wasobtained. Kiba dataset was used to train the model and determine the modelparameters. Compared with DeepDTA, WideDTA, graph attention network (GAT), GCNand graph isomorphism network (GIN) models, it was proved that the mean squareerror (MSE) of the proposed model was decreased by 0.055, 0.04, 0.001, 0.046,0.013 and the consistency index (CI) was increased by 0.028, 0.016, 0.003, 0.03and 0.01, respectively. It can predict the drug-target affinity more accurately. According to the prediction results of drug-target affinity of SARS-CoV-2 ionchannel targets, seven kinds of small molecule drugs acting on five ion channeltargets were obtained, namely SCH-47112, Dehydroaltenusin, alternariol5-o-sulfate, LPA1 antagonist 1, alternariol, butin, and AT-9283.These drugsprovide a reference for drug repositioning and precise treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - Identification of disease-drug associations is an effective strategy for drugrepurposing, especially in searching old drugs for newly emerged diseases likeCOVID-19. In this study, we put forward a network-based method named NEDNBI topredict disease-drug associations based on a gene-disease-drug tripartitenetwork, which could be applied in drug repurposing. The novelty of our methodlies in the fact that no negative data are required, and new disease could beadded into the disease-drug network with gene as the bridge. The comprehensiveevaluation results showed that the proposed method had good performance, with AUCvalue 0.948+/-0.009 for 10-fold cross validation. In a case study, 8 of the 20predicted old drugs have been tested clinically for the treatment of COVID-19,which illustrated the usefulness of our method in drug repurposing. The sourcecode and data of the method are available at https://github.com/Qli97/NEDNBI.

AB  - Despite recent advancements in the development of vaccines and monoclonalantibody therapies for Ebola virus disease, treatment options remain limited.Moreover, management and containment of Ebola virus outbreaks is often hinderedby the remote nature of the locations in which the outbreaks originate.Small-molecule compounds offer the advantage of being relatively cheap and easyto produce, transport and store, making them an interesting modality for thedevelopment of novel therapeutics against Ebola virus disease. Furthermore, therepurposing of small-molecule compounds, previously developed for alternativeapplications, can aid in reducing the time needed to bring potential therapeuticsfrom bench to bedside. For this purpose, the Medicines for Malaria Ventureprovides collections of previously developed small-molecule compounds forscreening against other infectious diseases. In this study, we used biologically contained Ebola virus to screen over 4,200 small-molecule drugs and drug-likecompounds provided by the Medicines for Malaria Venture (i.e., the PandemicResponse Box and the COVID Box) and the Centre for Drug Design and Discovery(CD3, KU Leuven, Belgium). In addition to confirming known Ebola virusinhibitors, illustrating the validity of our screening assays, we identifiedeight novel selective Ebola virus inhibitors. Although the inhibitory potentialof these compounds remains to be validated in vivo, they represent interestingcompounds for the study of potential interventions against Ebola virus diseaseand might serve as a basis for the development of new therapeutics.

AB  - The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemicand has caused a major health and economic burden worldwide. Understanding howSARS-CoV-2 viral proteins behave in host cells can reveal underlying mechanismsof pathogenesis and assist in development of antiviral therapies. Here, thecellular impact of expressing SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins was studied by globalproteomic analysis, and proximity biotinylation (BioID) was used to map theSARS-CoV-2 virus-host interactome in human lung cancer-derived cells. Functional enrichment analyses revealed previously reported and unreported cellular pathwaysthat are associated with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We have established a website tohost the proteomic data to allow for public access and continued analysis ofhost-viral protein associations and whole-cell proteomes of cells expressing the viral-BioID fusion proteins. Furthermore, we identified 66 high-confidenceinteractions by comparing this study with previous reports, providing a strongfoundation for future follow-up studies. Finally, we cross-referenced candidateinteractors with the CLUE drug library to identify potential therapeutics fordrug-repurposing efforts. Collectively, these studies provide a valuable resourceto uncover novel SARS-CoV-2 biology and inform development of antivirals.

LID - 10.3390/v14030612 [doi]
AB  - Viral replication and transmissibility are the principal causes of endemic andpandemic disease threats. There remains a need for broad-spectrum antiviralagents. The most common respiratory viruses are endemic agents such ascoronaviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, and influenza viruses. Althoughvaccines are available for SARS-CoV-2 and some influenza viruses, there is apaucity of effective antiviral drugs, while for RSV there is no vaccineavailable, and therapeutic treatments are very limited. We have previously shown that probenecid is safe and effective in limiting influenza A virus replicationand SARS-CoV-2 replication, along with strong evidence showing inhibition of RSV replication in vitro and in vivo.

LID - 573 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14030573 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a member of theCoronavirus family which caused the worldwide pandemic of human respiratoryillness coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Presumably emerging at the end of2019, it poses a severe threat to public health and safety, with a high incidenceof transmission, predominately through aerosols and/or direct contact withinfected surfaces. In 2020, the search for vaccines began, leading to theobtaining of, to date, about twenty COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in atleast one country. However, COVID-19 continues to spread and new geneticmutations and variants have been discovered, requiring pharmacologicaltreatments. The most common therapies for COVID-19 are represented by antiviraland antimalarial agents, antibiotics, immunomodulators, angiotensin II receptorblockers, bradykinin B2 receptor antagonists and corticosteroids. In addition,nutraceuticals, vitamins D and C, omega-3 fatty acids and probiotics are understudy. Finally, drug repositioning, which concerns the investigation of existing drugs for new therapeutic target indications, has been widely proposed in theliterature for COVID-19 therapies. Considering the importance of this ongoingglobal public health emergency, this review aims to offer a synthetic up-to-date overview regarding diagnoses, variants and vaccines for COVID-19, with particularattention paid to the adopted treatments.

TI  - NF-kappaB Signaling and Inflammation-Drug Repurposing to Treat InflammatoryDisorders?
LID - 372 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biology11030372 [doi]
AB  - NF-kappaB is a central mediator of inflammation, response to DNA damage andoxidative stress. As a result of its central role in so many important cellularprocesses, NF-kappaB dysregulation has been implicated in the pathology ofimportant human diseases. NF-kappaB activation causes inappropriate inflammatory responses in diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Thus, modulation of NF-kappaB signaling is being widely investigated as an approach to treat chronic inflammatory diseases, autoimmunity and cancer. Theemergence of COVID-19 in late 2019, the subsequent pandemic and the huge clinicalburden of patients with life-threatening SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia led to a massivescramble to repurpose existing medicines to treat lung inflammation in a widerange of healthcare systems. These efforts continue and have proven to becontroversial. Drug repurposing strategies are a promising alternative to de novodrug development, as they minimize drug development timelines and reduce the riskof failure due to unexpected side effects. Different experimental approaches havebeen applied to identify existing medicines which inhibit NF-kappaB that could berepurposed as anti-inflammatory drugs.

TI  - A Novel Deep Neural Network Technique for Drug-Target Interaction.
LID - 625 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14030625 [doi]
AB  - Drug discovery (DD) is a time-consuming and expensive process. Thus, the industryemploys strategies such as drug repositioning and drug repurposing, which allows the application of already approved drugs to treat a different disease, asoccurred in the first months of 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Theprediction of drug-target interactions is an essential part of the DD processbecause it can accelerate it and reduce the required costs. DTI predictionperformed in silico have used approaches based on molecular docking simulations, including similarity-based and network- and graph-based ones. This paper presentsMPS2IT-DTI, a DTI prediction model obtained from research conducted in thefollowing steps: the definition of a new method for encoding molecule and proteinsequences onto images; the definition of a deep-learning approach based on aconvolutional neural network in order to create a new method for DTI prediction. Training results conducted with the Davis and KIBA datasets show that MPS2IT-DTI is viable compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms ofperformance and complexity of the neural network model. With the Davis dataset,we obtained 0.876 for the concordance index and 0.276 for the MSE; with the KIBA dataset, we obtained 0.836 and 0.226 for the concordance index and the MSE,respectively. Moreover, the MPS2IT-DTI model represents molecule and proteinsequences as images, instead of treating them as an NLP task, and as such, doesnot employ an embedding layer, which is present in other models.

TI  - Sustained Release of Co-Amorphous Matrine-Type Alkaloids and Resveratrol withAnti-COVID-19 Potential.
LID - 603 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14030603 [doi]
AB  - Matrine (MAR), oxymatrine (OMAR), and sophoridine (SPD) are natural alkaloidswith varying biological activities; matrine was recently used for the treatmentof coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the short half-lives and rapidelimination of these matrine-type alkaloids would lead to low oralbioavailability and serious side effects. Herein, resveratrol (RES) was selected as a co-former to prepare their co-amorphous systems to improve the therapeuticindex. The formation of co-amorphous MAR-RES, OMAR-RES, and SPD-RES wasestablished through powder X-ray diffraction and modulated temperaturedifferential scanning calorimetry. Furthermore, Fourier transform infraredspectroscopy and NMR studies revealed the strong molecular interactions betweenresveratrol and these alkaloids, especially OMAR-RES. Matrine, oxymatrine, andsophoridine in the co-amorphous systems showed sustained release behaviors in thedissolution experiments, due to the recrystallization of resveratrol on thesurface of co-amorphous drugs. The three co-amorphous systems exhibited excellentphysicochemical stability under high relative humidity conditions. Our study not only showed that minor structural changes of active pharmaceutical ingredientsmay have distinct molecular interactions with the co-former, but also discovered a new type of sustained release mechanism for co-amorphous drugs. This promising co-amorphous drug approach may present a unique opportunity for repurposing thesevery promising drugs against COVID-19.

LID - 567 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14030567 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the Coronavirus becoming a new reality of our world, globalefforts continue to seek answers to many questions regarding the spread,variants, vaccinations, and medications. Particularly, with the emergence ofseveral strains (e.g., Delta, Omicron), vaccines will need further development tooffer complete protection against the new variants. It is critical to identifyantiviral treatments while the development of vaccines continues. In this regard,the repurposing of already FDA-approved drugs remains a major effort. In thispaper, we investigate the hypothesis that a combination of FDA-approved drugs maybe considered as a candidate for COVID-19 treatment if (1) there exists anevidence in the COVID-19 biomedical literature that suggests such a combination, and (2) there is match in the clinical trials space that validates this drugcombination. METHODS: We present a computational framework that is designed fordetecting drug combinations, using the following components (a) a Text-miningmodule: to extract drug names from the abstract section of the biomedicalpublications and the intervention/treatment sections of clinical trial records.(b) a network model constructed from the drug names and their associations, (c) aclique similarity algorithm to identify candidate drug treatments. RESULT ANDCONCLUSIONS: Our framework has identified treatments in the form of two, three,or four drug combinations (e.g., hydroxychloroquine, doxycycline, andazithromycin). The identifications of the various treatment candidates providedsufficient evidence that supports the trustworthiness of our hypothesis.

AB  - The persistency of COVID-19 in the world and the continuous rise of its variants demand new treatments to complement vaccines. Computational chemistry can assist in the identification of moieties able to lead to new drugs to fight the disease.Fullerenes and carbon nanomaterials can interact with proteins and are consideredpromising antiviral agents. Here, we propose the possibility to repurposefullerenes to clog the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 protease, M(pro). Throughthe use of docking, molecular dynamics, and energy decomposition techniques, itis shown that C60 has a substantial binding energy to the main protease of theSARS-CoV-2 virus, M(pro), higher than masitinib, a known inhibitor of theprotein. Furthermore, we suggest the use of C70 as an innovative scaffold for theinhibition of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). At odds with masitinib, both C60 and C70interact more strongly with SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) when different protonation statesof the catalytic dyad are considered. The binding of fullerenes to M(pro) is due to shape complementarity, i.e., vdW interactions, and is aspecific. As such, itis not sensitive to mutations that can eliminate or invert the charges of theamino acids composing the binding pocket. Fullerenic cages should therefore bemore effective against the SARS-CoV-2 virus than the available inhibitors such asmasinitib, where the electrostatic term plays a crucial role in the binding.

TI  - Plant-Derived Antiviral Compounds as Potential Entry Inhibitors against SpikeProtein of SARS-CoV-2 Wild-Type and Delta Variant: An Integrative inSilicoApproach.
LID - 1773 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27061773 [doi]
AB  - The wild-type SARS-CoV-2 has continuously evolved into several variants withincreased transmissibility and virulence. The Delta variant which was initiallyidentified in India created a devastating impact throughout the country duringthe second wave. While the efficacy of the existing vaccines against the latestSARS-CoV-2 variants remains unclear, extensive research is being carried out todevelop potential antiviral drugs through approaches like in silico screening anddrug-repurposing. This study aimed to conduct the docking-based virtual screeningof 50 potential phytochemical compounds against a Spike glycoprotein of thewild-type and the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant. Subsequently, molecular docking wasperformed for the five best compounds, such as Lupeol, Betulin, Hypericin,Corilagin, and Geraniin, along with synthetic controls. From the resultsobtained, it was evident that Lupeol exhibited a remarkable binding affinitytowards the wild-type Spike protein (-8.54 kcal/mol), while Betulin showedsignificant binding interactions with the mutated Spike protein (-8.83 kcal/mol),respectively. The binding energy values of the selected plant compounds wereslightly higher than that of the controls. Key hydrogen bonding and hydrophobicinteractions of the resulting complexes were visualized, which explained theirgreater binding affinity against the target proteins-the Delta S protein ofSARS-CoV-2, in particular. The lower RMSD, the RMSF values of the complexes andthe ligands, Rg, H-bonds, and the binding free energies of the complexes togetherrevealed the stability of the complexes and significant binding affinities of theligands towards the target proteins. Our study suggests that Lupeol and Betulincould be considered as potential ligands for SARS-CoV-2 spike antagonists.Further experimental validations might provide new insights for the possibleantiviral therapeutic interventions of the identified lead compounds and theiranalogs against COVID-19 infection.

AB  - The rising outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 continues to unfold all over the world. Thedevelopment of novel effective antiviral drugs to fight against SARS-CoV-2 is atime cost. As a result, some specific FDA-approved drugs have already beenrepurposed and authorized for COVID-19 treatment. The repurposed drugs used were either antiviral or non-antiviral drugs. Accordingly, the present reviewthoroughly focuses on the repurposing efficacy of these drugs including clinical trials experienced, the combination therapies used, the novel methods followedfor treatment, and their future perspective. Therefore, drug repurposing wasregarded as an effective avenue for COVID-19 treatment. Recently, molnupiravir isa prodrug antiviral medication that was approved in the United Kingdom inNovember 2021 for the treatment of COVID-19. On the other hand, PF-07321332 is anoral antiviral drug developed by Pfizer. For the treatment of COVID-19, thePF-07321332/ritonavir combination medication is used in Phase III studies and wasmarketed as Paxlovid. Herein, we represented the almost history of combatingCOVID-19 from repurposing to the recently available oral anti-SARS-CoV-2candidates, as a new hope to end the current pandemic.

AB  - The emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)has resulted in a long pandemic, with numerous cases and victims worldwide andenormous consequences on social and economic life. Although vaccinations haveproceeded and provide a valuable shield against the virus, the approved drugs arelimited and it is crucial that further ways to combat infection are developed,that can also act against potential mutations. The main protease (M(pro)) of the virus is an appealing target for the development of inhibitors, due to itsimportance in the viral life cycle and its high conservation among differentcoronaviruses. Several compounds have shown inhibitory potential against M(pro), both in silico and in vitro, with few of them also having entered clinicaltrials. These candidates include: known drugs that have been repurposed,molecules specifically designed based on the natural substrate of the protease oron structural moieties that have shown high binding affinity to the proteaseactive site, as well as naturally derived compounds, either isolated or in plant extracts. The aim of this work is to collectively present the results of researchregarding M(pro) inhibitors to date, focusing on the function of the compoundsfounded by in silico simulations and further explored by in vitro and in vivoassays. Creating an extended portfolio of promising compounds that may blockviral replication by inhibiting M(pro) and by understanding involvedstructure-activity relationships, could provide a basis for the development ofeffective solutions against SARS-CoV-2 and future related outbreaks.

AB  - The rapid spread of COVID-19 has become a health emergency causing an urgent needfor drug treatments to control the outbreak, especially in more vulnerableindividuals. This is reinforced by the fact that prophylactic vaccines andneutralizing monoclonal antibodies may not be fully effective against emergingvariants. Despite all efforts made by the scientific community, efficienttherapeutic options currently remain scarce, either in the initial, as well as inthe advanced forms of the disease. From retrospective observational studies andprospective clinical trials, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), andother antidepressants with functional inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase(FIASMAs), have emerged as potential treatments of COVID-19. This has led to someprematurely optimistic points of view, promoting a large prescription offluvoxamine in patients with COVID-19, that we think should be reasonablytempered.

AB  - The amplitude of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic motivatedglobal efforts to find therapeutics that avert severe forms of this illness. The urgency of the medical needs privileged repositioning of approved medicines.Methylene blue (MB) has been in clinical use for a century and proved especially useful as a photosensitizer for photodynamic disinfection (PDI). We describe the use of MB to photo-inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in samples collected from COVID-19patients. One minute of treatment can reduce the percentage inhibition ofamplification by 99.99% under conditions of low cytotoxicity. We employed apseudotyped lentiviral vector (LVs) encoding the luciferase reporter gene andexhibiting the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 at its surface, to infect humanACE2-expressing HEK293T cells. Pre-treatment of LVs with MB-PDI preventedinfection at low micromolar MB concentrations and 1 min of illumination. Theseresults reveal the potential of MB-PDI to reduce viral loads in the nasal cavity and oropharynx in the early stages of COVID-19, which may be employed to curb thetransmission and severity of the disease.

AB  - The current global health emergency in the form of the Coronavirus 2019(COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the need for fast, accurate, and efficientdrug discovery pipelines. Traditional drug discovery projects relying on in vitrohigh-throughput screening (HTS) involve large investments and sophisticatedexperimental set-ups, affordable only to big biopharmaceutical companies. In thisscenario, application of efficient state-of-the-art computational methods andmodern artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms for rapid screening ofrepurposable chemical space [approved drugs and natural products (NPs) withproven pharmacokinetic profiles] to identify the initial leads is a powerfuloption to save resources and time. Structure-based drug repurposing is a popular in silico repurposing approach. In this review, we discuss traditional and modernAI-based computational methods and tools applied at various stages forstructure-based drug discovery (SBDD) pipelines. Additionally, we highlight therole of generative models in generating molecules with scaffolds fromrepurposable chemical space.

TI  - Jumping from Fragment to Drug via Smart Scaffolds.
PG  - e202200092
LID - 10.1002/cmdc.202200092 [doi]
AB  - A focused drug repurposing approach is described where an FDA-approved drug isrationally selected for biological testing based on structural similarities to a fragment compound found to bind a target protein by an NMR screen. The approachis demonstrated by first screening a curated fragment library using (19) F NMR todiscover a quality binder to ACE2, the human receptor required for entry andinfection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Based on this binder, a highly relatedscaffold was derived and used as a "smart scaffold" or template in acomputer-aided finger-print search of a library of FDA-approved or marketeddrugs. The most interesting structural match involved the drug vortioxetine whichwas then experimentally shown by NMR spectroscopy to bind directly to human ACE2.Also, an ELISA assay showed that the drug inhibits the interaction of human ACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding-domain (RBD). Moreover, our cell-cultureinfectivity assay confirmed that vortioxetine is active against SARS-CoV-2 andinhibits viral replication. Thus, the use of "smart scaffolds" based on bindersfrom fragment screens may have general utility for identifying candidates ofFDA-approved or marketed drugs as a rapid repurposing strategy. Similarapproaches can be envisioned for other fields involving small-molecule chemicalapplications.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading. Researchers around the world are dedicated to finding the treatment clues for COVID-19. Drugrepositioning, as a rapid and cost-effective way for finding therapeutic options from available FDA-approved drugs, has been applied to drug discovery forCOVID-19. In this study, we develop a novel drug repositioning method (VDA-KLMF) to prioritize possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs integrating virus sequences, drugchemical structures, known Virus-Drug Associations, and Logistic MatrixFactorization with Kernel diffusion. First, Gaussian kernels of viruses and drugsare built based on known VDAs and nearest neighbors. Second, sequence similarity kernel of viruses and chemical structure similarity kernel of drugs areconstructed based on biological features and an identity matrix. Third, Gaussian kernel and similarity kernel are diffused. Forth, a logistic matrix factorizationmodel with kernel diffusion is proposed to identify potential anti-SARS-CoV-2drugs. Finally, molecular dockings between the inferred antiviral drugs and thejunction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-ACE2 interface are implemented toinvestigate the binding abilities between them. VDA-KLMF is compared with twostate-of-the-art VDA prediction models (VDA-KATZ and VDA-RWR) and three classicalassociation prediction methods (NGRHMDA, LRLSHMDA, and NRLMF) based on 5-foldcross validations on viruses, drugs, and VDAs on three datasets. It obtains thebest recalls, AUCs, and AUPRs, significantly outperforming other five methodsunder the three different cross validations. We observe that four chemical agentscoming together on any two datasets, that is, remdesivir, ribavirin,nitazoxanide, and emetine, may be the clues of treatment for COVID-19. Thedocking results suggest that the key residues K353 and G496 may affect thebinding energies and dynamics between the inferred anti-SARS-CoV-2 chemicalagents and the junction of the spike protein-ACE2 interface. Integrating various biological data, Gaussian kernel, similarity kernel, and logistic matrixfactorization with kernel diffusion, this work demonstrates that a few chemicalagents may assist in drug discovery for COVID-19.

AB  - Coagulopathy is a significant aspect of morbidity in COVID-19 patients. Theclotting cascade is propagated by a series of proteases, including factor Xa and thrombin. While certain host proteases, including TMPRSS2 and furin, are known tobe important for cleavage activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike to promote viral entryin the respiratory tract, other proteases may also contribute. Using biochemical and cell-based assays, we demonstrate that factor Xa and thrombin can alsodirectly cleave SARS-CoV-2 spike, enhancing infection at the stage of viralentry. Coagulation factors increased SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lungorganoids. A drug-repurposing screen identified a subset of protease inhibitorsthat promiscuously inhibited spike cleavage by both transmembrane serineproteases and coagulation factors. The mechanism of the protease inhibitorsnafamostat and camostat may extend beyond inhibition of TMPRSS2 tocoagulation-induced spike cleavage. Anticoagulation is critical in the managementof COVID-19, and early intervention could provide collateral benefit bysuppressing SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. We propose a model of positive feedbackwhereby infection-induced hypercoagulation exacerbates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Drug repurposing can be a successful approach to deal with thescarcity of cost-effective therapies in situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic.Tetracyclines have previously shown efficacy in preclinical acute respiratorydistress syndrome (ARDS) models and initial predictions and experimental reports suggest a direct antiviral activity against SARS-CoV2. Furthermore, a fewclinical reports indicate their potential in COVID-19 patients. In addition tothe scarcity and limitations of the scientific evidence, the effectiveness oftetracyclines in experimental ARDS has been proven extensively, counteracting theovert inflammatory reaction and fibrosis sequelae due to a synergic combinationof pharmacological activities. AREAS COVERED: This paper discusses the scientificevidence behind the application of tetracyclines for ARDS/COVID-19. EXPERTOPINION: The benefits of their multi-target pharmacology and their safety profileovercome the limitations, such as antibiotic activity and low commercialinterest. Immunomodulatory tetracyclines and novel chemically modifiednon-antibiotic tetracyclines have therapeutic potential. Further drug repurposingstudies in ARDS and severe COVID-19 are necessary.

TI  - ELECTRA-DTA: a new compound-protein binding affinity prediction model based onthe contextualized sequence encoding.
PG  - 14
LID - 10.1186/s13321-022-00591-x [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Drug-target binding affinity (DTA) reflects the strength of thedrug-target interaction; therefore, predicting the DTA can considerably benefitdrug discovery by narrowing the search space and pruning drug-target (DT) pairswith low binding affinity scores. Representation learning using deep neuralnetworks has achieved promising performance compared with traditional machinelearning methods; hence, extensive research efforts have been made in learningthe feature representation of proteins and compounds. However, such featurerepresentation learning relies on a large-scale labelled dataset, which is notalways available. RESULTS: We present an end-to-end deep learning framework,ELECTRA-DTA, to predict the binding affinity of drug-target pairs. This frameworkincorporates an unsupervised learning mechanism to train two ELECTRA-basedcontextual embedding models, one for protein amino acids and the other forcompound SMILES string encoding. In addition, ELECTRA-DTA leverages asqueeze-and-excitation (SE) convolutional neural network block stacked over threefully connected layers to further capture the sequential and spatial features of the protein sequence and SMILES for the DTA regression task. Experimentalevaluations show that ELECTRA-DTA outperforms various state-of-the-art DTAprediction models, especially with the challenging, interaction-sparse BindingDB dataset. In target selection and drug repurposing for COVID-19, ELECTRA-DTA also offers competitive performance, suggesting its potential in speeding drugdiscovery and generalizability for other compound- or protein-relatedcomputational tasks.

AB  - Compared with traditional de novo drug discovery, drug repurposing has become an attractive drug discovery strategy due to its low-cost and high efficiency.Through a comprehensive analysis of the candidates that have been identified withdrug repositioning potentials, it is found that although some drugs do not showobvious advantages in the original indications, they may exert more obviouseffects in other diseases. In addition, some drugs have a synergistic effect toexert better clinical efficacy if used in combination. Particularly, it has been confirmed that drug repositioning has benefits and values on the current publichealth emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which proved the great potential of drug repositioning. In this review, we systematically reviewed a series ofrepresentative drugs that have been repositioned for different diseases andillustrated successful cases in each disease. Especially, the mechanism of actionfor the representative drugs in new indications were explicitly explored for eachdisease, we hope this review can provide important insights for follow-upresearch.

PG  - 1-9

AB  - Malaria is an ancient infectious disease that threatens millions of livesglobally even today. The discovery of artemisinin, inspired by traditionalChinese medicine (TCM), has brought in a paradigm shift and been recognized asthe "best hope for the treatment of malaria" by World Health Organization. Withits high potency and low toxicity, the wide use of artemisinin effectively treatsthe otherwise drug-resistant parasites and helps many countries, including China,to eventually eradicate malaria. Here, we will first review the initial discoveryof artemisinin, an extraordinary journey that was in stark contrast with manydrugs in western medicine. We will then discuss how artemisinin and itsderivatives could be repurposed to treat cancer, inflammation,immunoregulation-related diseases, and COVID-19. Finally, we will discuss theimplications of the "artemisinin story" and how that can better guide thedevelopment of TCM today. We believe that artemisinin is just a starting pointand TCM will play an even bigger role in healthcare in the 21st century.

AB  - Although extrapulmonary manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) areincreasingly reported, no effective therapeutic strategy for these multisystemic complications is available due to a poor understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 multiorgan involvement. In this study, differentially expressed genes(DEGs) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infectedextrapulmonary organs including human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs)-derivedliver organoids and choroid plexus organoids besides transformed lung alveolar(A549) cells were analyzed. First, pathway enrichment analysis was done tocompare the underlying biological pathways enriched upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in different organs. Then, these lists of DEGs were used in a connectivity map(CMap)-based drug repurposing experiment. Also, protein-protein interaction (PPI)network analysis was done to compare the associated hub genes. The resultsrevealed different biological pathways and genes responsible for SARS-CoV-2multisystemic pathogenesis based on the organ involved that highlighted the need for considering organ-specific treatments or even personalized therapy. Besides, some FDA-approved drugs were proposed as the potential therapeutic candidates foreach infected cell line.

AB  - Molecular docking results of two training sets containing 866 and 8,696 compoundswere used to train three different machine learning (ML) approaches. Neuralnetwork approaches according to Keras and TensorFlow libraries and the gradientboosted decision trees approach of XGBoost were used with DScribe's SmoothOverlap of Atomic Positions molecular descriptors. In addition, neural networksusing the SchNetPack library and descriptors were used. The ML performance wastested on three different sets, including compounds for future organic synthesis.The final evaluation of the ML predicted docking scores was based on the ZINC in vivo set, from which 1,200 compounds were randomly selected with respect to theirsize. The results obtained showed a consistent ML prediction capability ofdocking scores, and even though compounds with more than 60 atoms were foundslightly overestimated they remain valid for a subsequent evaluation of theirdrug repurposing suitability.

AB  - The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, along with the likelihood that new coronavirusstrains will appear in the nearby future, highlights the urgent need to developnew effective antiviral agents. In this scenario, emerging host-targetingantivirals (HTAs), which act on host-cell factors essential for viralreplication, are a promising class of antiviral compounds. Here we show that anew class of HTAs targeting peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs), a family ofcalcium-dependent enzymes catalyzing protein citrullination, is endowed with apotent inhibitory activity against human beta-coronaviruses (HCoVs).Specifically, we show that infection of human fetal lung fibroblasts withHCoV-OC43 leads to enhanced protein citrullination through transcriptionalactivation of PAD4, and that inhibition of PAD4-mediated citrullination witheither of the two pan-PAD inhibitors Cl-A and BB-Cl or the PAD4-specificinhibitor GSK199 curbs HCoV-OC43 replication. Furthermore, we show that eitherCl-A or BB-Cl treatment of African green monkey kidney Vero-E6 cells, a widelyused cell system to study beta-CoV replication, potently suppresses HCoV-OC43 andSARS-CoV-2 replication. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential efficacyof PAD inhibitors, in suppressing HCoV infection, which may provide the rationalefor the repurposing of this class of inhibitors for the treatment of COVID-19patients.

AB  - Identifying signaling pathways and molecules involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is pivotal for developing new effective therapeutic or preventive strategies for COVID-19. Pannexins (PANX) are ATP-release channels in the plasma membraneessential in many physiological and immune responses. Activation of pannexinchannels and downstream purinergic receptors play dual roles in viral infection, either by facilitating viral replication and infection or inducing host antiviraldefense. The current review provides a hypothesis demonstrating the possiblecontribution of the PANX1 channel and purinergic receptors in SARS-CoV-2pathogenesis and mechanism of action. Moreover, we discuss whether targetingthese signaling pathways may provide promising preventative therapies andtreatments for patients with progressive COVID-19 resulting from excessivepro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines production. Several inhibitors of this pathway have been developed for the treatment of other viral infections andpathological consequences. Specific PANX1 inhibitors could be potentiallyincluded as part of the COVID-19 treatment regimen if, in future, studiesdemonstrate the role of PANX1 in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Of note, any ATPtherapeutic modulation for COVID-19 should be carefully designed and monitoredbecause of the complex role of extracellular ATP in cellular physiology.

AB  - Compound repurposing is an important strategy for the identification of effectivetreatment options against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. In thisregard, SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CL-Pro), also termed M-Pro, is an attractivedrug target as it plays a central role in viral replication by processing theviral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab at multiple distinct cleavage sites. We herereport the results of a repurposing program involving 8.7 K compounds containing marketed drugs, clinical and preclinical candidates, and small molecules regardedas safe in humans. We confirmed previously reported inhibitors of 3CL-Pro andhave identified 62 additional compounds with IC50 values below 1 muM and profiledtheir selectivity toward chymotrypsin and 3CL-Pro from the Middle Eastrespiratory syndrome virus. A subset of eight inhibitors showed anticytopathiceffect in a Vero-E6 cell line, and the compounds thioguanosine and MG-132 wereanalyzed for their predicted binding characteristics to SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Pro. TheX-ray crystal structure of the complex of myricetin and SARS-Cov-2 3CL-Pro wassolved at a resolution of 1.77 A, showing that myricetin is covalently bound tothe catalytic Cys145 and therefore inhibiting its enzymatic activity.

AB  - The current Covid-19 pandemic has underlined the need for a more coordinated and forward-looking investment in the search for new medicines targeting emerginghealth care threats. Repositioning currently approved drugs is a popular approachto any new emerging disease, but it represents a first wave of response. Behindthis would be a second wave of more specifically designed therapies based onactivities against specific molecular targets or in phenotypic assays. Following the successful deployment and uptake of previous open access compoundcollections, we assembled the Pandemic Response Box, a collection of 400compounds to facilitate drug discovery in emerging infectious disease. These are based on public domain information on chemotypes currently in discovery and earlydevelopment which have been shown to have useful activities and were prioritized by medicinal chemistry experts. They are freely available to the community as apharmacological test set with the understanding that data will be shared rapidly in the public domain.

AB  - Over the last decade, for the first time, substantial efforts have been directed at the development of dedicated in silico platforms for drug repurposing,including initiatives targeting cancers and conditions as diverse ascryptosporidiosis, dengue, dental caries, diabetes, herpes, lupus, malaria,tuberculosis and Covid-19 related respiratory disease. This review outlines some of the exciting advances in the specific applications of in silico approaches to the challenge of drug repurposing and focuses particularly on where these effortshave resulted in the development of generic platform technologies of broad value to researchers involved in programmatic drug repurposing work. Recent advances inmolecular docking methodologies and validation approaches, and their combination with machine learning or deep learning approaches are continually enhancing theprecision of repurposing efforts. The meaningful integration of betterunderstanding of molecular mechanisms with molecular pathway data and knowledgeof disease networks is widening the scope for discovery of repurposingopportunities. The power of Artificial Intelligence is being gainfully exploited to advance progress in an integrated science that extends from the sub-atomic to the whole system level. There are many promising emerging developments but there are remaining challenges to be overcome in the successful integration of the new advances in useful platforms. In conclusion, the essential component requirementsfor development of powerful and well optimised drug repurposing screeningplatforms are discussed.

AB  - Since the first reports from December 2019, COVID-19 caused an overwhelmingglobal pandemic that has affected 223 countries, seriously endangering publichealth and creating an urgent need for effective drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2infection. Currently, there is a lack of safe, effective, and specifictherapeutic drugs for COVID-19, with mainly supportive and symptomatic treatmentsbeing administered to patients. The preferred option for responding to anoutbreak of acute infectious disease is through drug repurposing, saving valuabletime that would otherwise be lost in preclinical and clinical research, hasteningclinical introduction, and lowering treatment costs. Alternatively, researchersseek to design and discover novel small-molecule candidate drugs targeting thekey proteins in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 through an in-depth study of theinfection mechanism, thus obtaining a number of candidate compounds withfavorable antiviral effects in preclinical and clinical settings. There is anurgent need to further elucidate the efficacy and mechanism of action ofpotential anti-SARS-CoV-2 small-molecule drugs. Herein, we review the candidatesmall-molecule anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in ongoing clinical trials, with a majorfocus on their mechanisms of action in an attempt to provide useful insight forfurther research and development of small-molecule compounds against SARS-CoV-2infection.

AB  - The pandemic threat of COVID-19 has severely destroyed human life as well as the economy around the world. Although, the vaccination has reduced the outspread,but people are still suffering due to the unstable RNA sequence patterns ofSARS-CoV-2 which demands supplementary drugs. To explore novel drug targetproteins, in this study, a transcriptomics RNA-Seq data generated from SARS-CoV-2infection and control samples were analyzed. We identified 109 differentiallyexpressed genes (DEGs) that were utilized to identify 10 hub-genes/proteins(TLR2, USP53, GUCY1A2, SNRPD2, NEDD9, IGF2, CXCL2, KLF6, PAG1 and ZFP36) by theprotein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. The GO functional and KEGGpathway enrichment analyses of hub-DEGs revealed some important functions andsignaling pathways that are significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections. The interaction network analysis identified 5 TFs proteins and 6 miRNAs as thekey regulators of hub-DEGs. Considering 10 hub-proteins and 5 key TFs-proteins asdrug target receptors, we performed their docking analysis with the SARS-CoV-23CL protease-guided top listed 90 FDA approved drugs. We found Torin-2,Rapamycin, Radotinib, Ivermectin, Thiostrepton, Tacrolimus and Daclatasvir as thetop ranked seven candidate drugs. We investigated their resistance performanceagainst the already published COVID-19 causing top-ranked 11 independent and 8protonated receptor proteins by molecular docking analysis and found their strongbinding affinities, which indicates that the proposed drugs are effective againstthe state-of-the-arts alternatives independent receptor proteins also. Finally,we investigated the stability of top three drugs (Torin-2, Rapamycin andRadotinib) by using 100 ns MD-based MM-PBSA simulations with the two top-rankedproposed receptors (TLR2, USP53) and independent receptors (IRF7, STAT1), andobserved their stable performance. Therefore, the proposed drugs might play avital role for the treatment against different variants of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

TI  - Mining Electronic Health Records for Drugs Associated With 28-day Mortality inCOVID-19: Pharmacopoeia-wide Association Study (PharmWAS).
PG  - e35190

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients hospitalized for a given condition may be receiving othertreatments for other contemporary conditions or comorbidities. The use of suchobservational clinical data for pharmacological hypothesis generation isappealing in the context of an emerging disease but particularly challenging due to the presence of drug indication bias. OBJECTIVE: With this study, our mainobjective was the development and validation of a fully data-driven pipeline thatwould address this challenge. Our secondary objective was to generatepharmacological hypotheses in patients with COVID-19 and demonstrate the clinicalrelevance of the pipeline. METHODS: We developed a pharmacopeia-wide association study (PharmWAS) pipeline inspired from the PheWAS methodology, whichsystematically screens for associations between the whole pharmacopeia and aclinical phenotype. First, a fully data-driven procedure based on adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) determined drug-specificadjustment sets. Second, we computed several measures of association, includingrobust methods based on propensity scores (PSs) to control indication bias.Finally, we applied the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure of the false discoveryrate (FDR). We applied this method in a multicenter retrospective cohort studyusing electronic medical records from 16 university hospitals of the GreaterParis area. We included all adult patients between 18 and 95 years oldhospitalized in conventional wards for COVID-19 between February 1, 2020, andJune 15, 2021. We investigated the association between drug prescription within48 hours from admission and 28-day mortality. We validated our data-drivenpipeline against a knowledge-based pipeline on 3 treatments of reference, forwhich experts agreed on the expected association with mortality. We thendemonstrated its clinical relevance by screening all drugs prescribed in morethan 100 patients to generate pharmacological hypotheses. RESULTS: A total of5783 patients were included in the analysis. The median age at admission was 69.2(IQR 56.7-81.1) years, and 3390 (58.62%) of the patients were male. Theperformance of our automated pipeline was comparable or better for controllingbias than the knowledge-based adjustment set for 3 reference drugs:dexamethasone, phloroglucinol, and paracetamol. After correction for multipletesting, 4 drugs were associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Amongthese, diazepam and tramadol were the only ones not discarded by automateddiagnostics, with adjusted odds ratios of 2.51 (95% CI 1.52-4.16, Q=.1) and 1.94 (95% CI 1.32-2.85, Q=.02), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our innovative approachproved useful in generating pharmacological hypotheses in an outbreak setting,without requiring a priori knowledge of the disease. Our systematic analysis ofearly prescribed treatments from patients hospitalized for COVID-19 showed thatdiazepam and tramadol are associated with increased 28-day mortality. Whetherthese drugs could worsen COVID-19 needs to be further assessed.

AB  - Identification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds through traditional high-throughputscreening (HTS) assays is limited by high costs and low hit rates. To addressthese challenges, we developed machine learning models to identify compoundsacting via inhibition of the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human host cells or theSARS-CoV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like (3CL) protease. The optimal classification models achieved good performance with area under the receiver operating characteristiccurve (AUC-ROC) values of >0.78. Experimental validation showed that the bestperforming models increased the assay hit rate by 2.1-fold for viral entryinhibitors and 10.4-fold for 3CL protease inhibitors compared to those of theoriginal drug repurposing screens. Twenty-two compounds showed potent (<5 muM)antiviral activities in a SARS-CoV-2 live virus assay. In conclusion, machinelearning models can be developed and used as a complementary approach to HTS toexpand compound screening capacities and improve the speed and efficiency ofanti-SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery.

AB  - Before the rise of SARS-CoV-2, emergence of different coronaviruses such asSARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has been reported that indicates possibility of the future novel pathogen from the coronavirus family at a pandemic level. In this context, explicit studies on identifying inhibitors focused on the coronavirus life cycle,are immensely important. The main protease is critical for the life cycle ofcoronaviruses. Majority of the work done on the inhibitor studies on thecatalytically active dimeric SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)), primarilyfocussed on the catalytic site of a single protomer, with a few targeting thedimeric site. In this study, we have exploited the FDA-approved drugs, for acomputational drug repurposing study against the M(pro). A virtual screeningapproach was employed with docking and molecular dynamics (MD) methods. Out of1576, FDA-approved compounds, our study suggests three compounds: netupitant,paliperidone and vilazodone as possible inhibitors with a potential to inhibitboth sites (monomeric and dimeric) of the M(pro). These compounds were found tobe stable during the MD simulations and their post simulation binding energieswere also correlated for both the targeted sites, suggesting equal bindingcapacity. This unique efficiency of the reported compounds might support further experimental studies on developing inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 mainprotease.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

TI  - Azithromycin Misuse During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study fromJordan.

AB  - Objective: Since coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) became a global pandemic,repurposing known drugs was the quickest way to combat the disease. The initialscreening revealed that azithromycin (AZM) might have potential against COVID-19.Although clinical trials did not prove such efficacy, many countries have put AZMwithin their guidelines for treating COVID-19. Therefore, the present study wasdesigned to assess the misuse of AZM in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods and Results: A cross-sectional study was conducted among communitypharmacies in Jordan from March 27 to May 8, 2021, and 184 pharmacies data werecollected from the Google forms. During COVID-19, 42.9% of pharmacies sold morethan 20 packs of prescribed AZM per month compared to 46.7% of pharmacies used tosell 0-5 packs AZM prescriptions per month before the pandemic. During COVID-19, pharmacists significantly dispensed AZM with and without prescriptions 107% and127%, respectively, more than before the pandemic (p < 0.0001). Overall,pharmacists stocked 121% more AZM packs during COVID-19 than before the pandemic (p < 0.0001). Additionally, most pharmacists (59.7%) believed that AZM could cureCOVID-19 patients. However, using multinomial logistic regression analysis,low-experienced pharmacists were unsure if AZM could positively affect COVID-19patients (p < 0.05, OR = 3.76, 95% CI = 1.23-11.52). Furthermore, low-experiencedpharmacists believed that increased use of AZM for the treatment of viralinfections could lead to negative consequences (p < 0.001, OR = 0.161, 95% CI0.063-0.414). Conclusion: This study demonstrated that AZM is misused byphysicians, pharmacists, and the public in Jordan. Since AZM efficacy onSARS-CoV-2 is scarce, there is a need for new guidelines by governmental healthauthorities to implement strict enforcement of AZM dispensing during COVID-19 to avoid negative consequences of bacterial resistance.

AB  - Background: The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novelcoronavirus (COVID-19) as a global health emergency on January 30, 2020, and as apandemic disease on March 11, 2020. This review highlights the internationalsituation, risk factors, and related protections to be taken as prerequisitemeasures and probable treatment options for the COVID-19-infected population inthe current scenario. Main text: The SARS-CoV-2 viruses and their variants causedmild-to-severe respiratory tract infection and used airborne pathways as a way ofcontagion. Human-to-human transmission led to an exponential growth in the risein the number of cases making it a real burden to immobilize the rapid spread of the virus while asymptomatic patients created ambiguity for confirmation in thecommunity. It was clear from the case studies of patients that most of them were asymptomatic but still vulnerable to the people around, and hence, in a flash,many countries around the globe went into a complete lockdown, influencing theeconomy and thrashing industrial outputs. On the other hand, numerous researches were made to counteract the spread through studies in antiviral therapy,immune-based therapy, vaccination development, and natural remedies. Conclusion: Although exploration for a specific drug required for the COVID-19 treatment isunder extensive research worldwide and some of them are in clinical trial now.Virtual drug library screening is one of the current techniques for repurposingaccessible compounds. This review could provide beneficial information about the potential current and future treatment strategies to treat the pandemic COVID-19 infection.

AB  - Many drugs are being administered to tackle coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)pandemic situations without establishing clinical effectiveness or tailoringsafety. A repurposing strategy might be more effective and successful ifpharmacogenetic interventions are being considered in future clinicalstudies/trials. Although it is very unlikely that there are almost nopharmacogenetic data for COVID-19 drugs, however, from inferring thepharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic(PD) properties and some pharmacogeneticevidence in other diseases/clinical conditions, it is highly likely thatpharmacogenetic associations are also feasible in at least some COVID-19 drugs.We strongly mandate to undertake a pharmacogenetic assessment for at least these drug-gene pairs (atazanavir-UGT1A1, ABCB1, SLCO1B1, APOA5; efavirenz-CYP2B6;nevirapine-HLA, CYP2B6, ABCB1; lopinavir-SLCO1B3, ABCC2; ribavirin-SLC28A2;tocilizumab-FCGR3A; ivermectin-ABCB1; oseltamivir-CES1, ABCB1;clopidogrel-CYP2C19, ABCB1, warfarin-CYP2C9, VKORC1; non-steroidalanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)-CYP2C9) in COVID-19 patients for advancingprecision medicine. Molecular docking and computational studies are promising to achieve new therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The current situation inthe discovery of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents at four important targets from in silico studies has been described and summarized in this review. Although naturaloccurring compounds from different herbs against SARS-CoV-2 infection arefavorable, however, accurate experimental investigation of these compounds iswarranted to provide insightful information. Moreover, clinical considerations ofdrug-drug interactions (DDIs) and drug-herb interactions (DHIs) of the existingrepurposed drugs along with pharmacogenetic (e.g., efavirenz and CYP2B6) andherbogenetic (e.g., andrographolide and CYP2C9) interventions, collectivelycalled multifactorial drug-gene interactions (DGIs), may further accelerate thedevelopment of precision COVID-19 therapies in the real-world clinical settings.

AB  - Novel SARS coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that was identifiedand spread from Wuhan in 2019. On January 30th, the World Health Organizationdeclared the coronavirus outbreak as a Global Public Health Emergency. AlthoughRemdesivir and Molnupiravir are FDA-approved drugs for COVID-19, finding newefficient and low-cost antiviral drugs against COVID-19 for applying in morecountries can still be helpful. One of the potential sources for finding new and low-cost drugs is the herbal compounds in addition to repurposing FDA-approveddrugs. So, in this study, we focused on finding effective drug candidates againstCOVID-19 based on the computational approaches. As ACE2 serves as a criticalreceptor for cell entry of this virus. Inhibiting the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 on human ACE2 provides a promising therapeutic approach for developing drugsagainst SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we applied a bioinformatics approach to identifypossible potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. A library of FDA-approved compounds and five natural compounds was screened using Smina docking. Top-dockingcompounds are then applied in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation to assess thestability of ACE2-inhibitor complexes. Results indicate that Luteolin and Chrysinrepresent high conformation stability with ACE2 during 120 ns of MolecularDynamics simulation. The binding free energies of Luteolin and Chrysin werecalculated by the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area method(MM/PBSA) which confirmed the relative binding free energy of these drugs to ACE2in favor of the effective binding. So, Luteolin and Chrysin could sufficientlyinteract with ACE2 and block the Spike binding pocket of ACE2 and can be apotential inhibitor against the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 receptor which isan early stage of infection. Luteolin and Chrysin could be suggestive asbeneficial compounds for preventing or reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission andinfection which need experimental work to prove.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug repurposing aims at finding new targets for already developeddrugs. It becomes more relevant as the cost of discovering new drugs steadilyincreases. To find new potential targets for a drug, an abundance of methods and existing biomedical knowledge from different domains can be leveraged. Recently, knowledge graphs have emerged in the biomedical domain that integrate informationabout genes, drugs, diseases and other biological domains. Knowledge graphs canbe used to predict new connections between compounds and diseases, leveraging theinterconnected biomedical data around them. While real world use cases such asdrug repurposing are only interested in one specific relation type, widely usedknowledge graph embedding models simultaneously optimize over all relation types in the graph. This can lead the models to underfit the data that is most relevantfor the desired relation type. For example, if we want to learn embeddings topredict links between compounds and diseases but almost the entirety of relationsin the graph is incident to other pairs of entity types, then the resultingembeddings are likely not optimised to predict links between compounds anddiseases. We propose a method that leverages domain knowledge in the form ofmetapaths and use them to filter two biomedical knowledge graphs (Hetionet andDRKG) for the purpose of improving performance on the prediction task of drugrepurposing while simultaneously increasing computational efficiency. RESULTS: Wefind that our method reduces the number of entities by 60% on Hetionet and 26% onDRKG, while leading to an improvement in prediction performance of up to 40.8% onHetionet and 14.2% on DRKG, with an average improvement of 20.6% on Hetionet and 8.9% on DRKG. Additionally, prioritization of antiviral compounds for SARS CoV-2 improves after task-driven filtering is applied. CONCLUSION: Knowledge graphscontain facts that are counter productive for specific tasks, in our case drugrepurposing. We also demonstrate that these facts can be removed, resulting in animproved performance in that task and a more efficient learning process.

AB  - The acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)/ceramide system may provide a useful frameworkfor better understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection and the repurposing of psychotropicmedications functionally inhibiting the acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide system(named FIASMA psychotropic medications) against COVID-19. We examined thepotential usefulness of FIASMA psychotropic medications in patients withpsychiatric disorders hospitalized for severe COVID-19, in an observationalmulticenter study conducted at Greater Paris University hospitals. Of 545 adultinpatients, 164 (30.1%) received a FIASMA psychotropic medication upon hospitaladmission for COVID-19. We compared the composite endpoint of intubation or deathbetween patients who received a psychotropic FIASMA medication at baseline andthose who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusted for sociodemographiccharacteristics, psychiatric and other medical comorbidity, and othermedications. FIASMA psychotropic medication use at baseline was significantlyassociated with reduced risk of intubation or death in both crude (HR = 0.42;95%CI = 0.31-0.57; p < 0.01) and primary inverse probability weighting (IPW) (HR = 0.50; 95%CI = 0.37-0.67; p < 0.01) analyses. This association was not specific to one FIASMA psychotropic class or medication. Patients taking a FIASMAantidepressant at baseline had a significantly reduced risk of intubation ordeath compared with those taking a non-FIASMA antidepressant at baseline in both crude (HR = 0.57; 95%CI = 0.38-0.86; p < 0.01) and primary IPW (HR = 0.57; 95%CI = 0.37-0.87; p < 0.01) analyses. These associations remained significant inmultiple sensitivity analyses. Our results show the potential importance of theASM/ceramide system framework in COVID-19 and support the continuation of FIASMA psychotropic medications in these patients and the need of large- scale clinical trials evaluating FIASMA medications, and particularly FIASMA antidepressants,against COVID-19.

TI  - Gramicidin S and melittin: potential anti-viral therapeutic peptides to treatSARS-CoV-2 infection.
PG  - 3446
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-07341-x [doi]
AB  - The COVID19 pandemic has led to multipronged approaches for treatment of thedisease. Since de novo discovery of drugs is time consuming, repurposing ofmolecules is now considered as one of the alternative strategies to treatCOVID19. Antibacterial peptides are being recognized as attractive candidates forrepurposing to treat viral infections. In this study, we describe theanti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of the well-studied antibacterial peptides gramicidin S and melittin obtained from Bacillus brevis and bee venom respectively. The EC50values for gramicidin S and melittin were 1.571 microg and 0.656 microgrespectively based on in vitro antiviral assay. Significant decrease in the viralload as compared to the untreated group with no/very less cytotoxicity wasobserved. Both the peptides treated to the SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells showed viral clearance from 12 h onwards with a maximal viral clearance after 24 h post infection. Proteomics analysis indicated that more than 250 proteins weredifferentially regulated in the gramicidin S and melittin treated SARS-CoV-2infected Vero cells against control SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells after 24 and48 h post infection. The identified proteins were found to be associated in themetabolic and mRNA processing of the Vero cells post-treatment and infection.Both these peptides could be attractive candidates for repurposing to treatSARS-CoV-2 infection.

TI  - Can Panax ginseng help control cytokine storm in COVID-19?
PG  - 337-347
LID - 10.1016/j.jgr.2022.02.006 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently a pandemic caused by severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 are directlyassociated with hyper-activation of innate immune response that excessivelyproduce pro-inflammatory cytokines and induce cytokine storm, leading tomulti-organ-failure and significant morbidity/mortality. Currently, severalantiviral drugs such as Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir) and molnupiravirare authorized to treat mild to moderate COVID-19, however, there are still nodrugs that can specifically fight against challenges of SARS-CoV-2 variants.Panax ginseng, a medicinal plant widely used for treating various conditions,might be appropriate for this need due to its anti-inflammatory/cytokine/viralactivities, fewer side effects, and cost efficiency. To review Panax ginseng and its pharmacologically active-ingredients as potential phytopharmaceuticals fortreating cytokine storm of COVID-19, articles that reporting its positive effectson the cytokine production were searched from academic databases.Experimental/clinical evidences for the effectiveness of Panax ginseng and itsactive-ingredients in preventing or mitigating cytokine storm, especially for thecascade of cytokine storm, suggest that they might be beneficial as an adjuncttreatment for cytokine storm of COVID-19. This review may provide a new approach to discover specific medications using Panax ginseng to control cytokine storm ofCOVID-19.

LID - 10.1128/mbio.03705-21 [doi]
AB  - Combinations of direct-acting antivirals are needed to minimize drug resistancemutations and stably suppress replication of RNA viruses. Currently, there arelimited therapeutic options against the severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and testing of a number of drug regimens has led toconflicting results. Here, we show that cobicistat, which is an FDA-approved drugbooster that blocks the activity of the drug-metabolizing proteins cytochromeP450-3As (CYP3As) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Twoindependent cell-to-cell membrane fusion assays showed that the antiviral effect of cobicistat is exerted through inhibition of spike protein-mediated membranefusion. In line with this, incubation with low-micromolar concentrations ofcobicistat decreased viral replication in three different cell lines includingcells of lung and gut origin. When cobicistat was used in combination withremdesivir, a synergistic effect on the inhibition of viral replication wasobserved in cell lines and in a primary human colon organoid. This was consistentwith the effects of cobicistat on two of its known targets, CYP3A4 and P-gp, the silencing of which boosted the in vitro antiviral activity of remdesivir in acobicistat-like manner. When administered in vivo to Syrian hamsters at a highdose, cobicistat decreased viral load and mitigated clinical progression. Thesedata highlight cobicistat as a therapeutic candidate for treating SARS-CoV-2infection and as a potential building block of combination therapies forCOVID-19. IMPORTANCE The lack of effective antiviral treatments againstSARS-CoV-2 is a significant limitation in the fight against the COVID-19pandemic. Single-drug regimens have so far yielded limited results, indicatingthat combinations of antivirals might be required, as previously seen for otherRNA viruses. Our work introduces the drug booster cobicistat, which is approvedby the FDA and typically used to potentiate the effect of anti-HIV proteaseinhibitors, as a candidate inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Beyond its directactivity as an antiviral, we show that cobicistat can enhance the effect ofremdesivir, which was one of the first drugs proposed for treatment ofSARS-CoV-2. Overall, the dual action of cobicistat as a direct antiviral and adrug booster can provide a new approach to design combination therapies andrescue the activity of compounds that are only partially effective inmonotherapy.

AB  - The expansion of COVID-19 in the world has not ended yet, and the situation inJapan is still unpredictable. Under these circumstances, the development ofSARS-CoV-2 treatments such as vaccines and medicines is still underway. We havebeen conducting research on the drug screening for SARS-CoV-2 using thesupercomputer "Fugaku". Specifically, we searched for and identified therapeutic drug candidates that showed high affinity to the target protein (main protease)related to the multiplication of SARS-CoV-2 from among about 2,000 existing drugsby performing molecular dynamics calculations using Fugaku. This is the firstattempt in the world to screen drugs on a scale of several thousand usingmolecular dynamics calculations, and it is a case where we were able to take onthe challenge because Fugaku is ranked No. 1 in the world. In this chapter, wewill show the impact of the supercomputer "Fugaku" on drug discovery using oursearch for therapeutic agents for SARS-CoV-2 as an example.

AB  - Although researchers have been working tirelessly since the COVID-19 outbreak, sofar only three drugs - remdesivir, ronapreve and molnupiravir - have beenapproved for use in some countries which directly target the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Given the slow pace and substantial costs of new drug discovery and development, together with the urgency of the matter, repurposing of existing drugs for theongoing disease is an attractive proposition. In a recent study, ahigh-throughput X-ray crystallographic screen was performed for a selection ofdrugs which have been approved or are in clinical trials. Thirty-seven compounds have been identified from drug libraries all of which bind to the SARS-CoV-2 mainprotease (3CL(pro)). In the current study, we use molecular dynamics simulationand an ensemble-based free energy approach, namely, enhanced sampling ofmolecular dynamics with approximation of continuum solvent (ESMACS), toinvestigate a subset of the aforementioned compounds. The drugs studied here are highly diverse, interacting with different binding sites and/or subsites of3CL(pro). The predicted free energies are compared with experimental resultswherever they are available and they are found to be in excellent agreement. Our study also provides detailed energetic insights into the nature of the associateddrug-protein binding, in turn shedding light on the design and discovery ofpotential drugs.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the global economy andpublic health. Its etiologic agent, the severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly transmissible, pathogenic and has a rapidglobal spread. Currently, the increase in the number of new confirmed cases hasbeen slowed down due to the increase of vaccination in some regions of the world.Still, the rise of new variants has influenced the detection of additional waves of rising cases that some countries have experienced. Since the virus replicationcycle is composed of many distinct stages, some viral proteins related to them,as the main-protease (Mpro) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), constituteindividual potential antiviral targets. In this study, we challenged thementioned enzymes against compounds pre-approved by health regulatory agencies ina virtual screening and later in Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Bolzmann SurfaceArea (MM/PBSA) analysis. Our results showed that, among the identified potential drugs with anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties, Hypericin, an important component of theHypericum perforatum that presents antiviral and antitumoral properties, bindswith high affinity to viral Mpro and RdRp. Furthermore, we evaluated the activityof Hypericin anti-SARS-CoV-2 replication in an in vitro model of Vero-E6 infectedcells. Therefore, we show that Hypericin inhibited viral replication in a dosedependent manner. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of the compound, in cultured cells, was evaluated, but no significant activity was found. Thus, the results observed in this study indicate that Hypericin is an excellent candidate for repurposingfor the treatment of COVID-19, with possible inhibition of two important phasesof virus maturation.

AB  - Bovine lactoferrin (bLF), a naturally occurring glycoprotein found in milk, hasbioactive characteristics against many microbes, viruses, and other pathogens.Bovine lactoferrin strongly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro through directentry inhibition and immunomodulatory mechanisms. This study reports on theanti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy of commercially available bLF and common dairyingredients in the human lung cell line H1437 using a custom high-content imagingand analysis pipeline. We also show for the first time that bLF has potentefficacy across different viral strains including the South African B.1.351, UKB.1.1.7, Brazilian P.1, and Indian Delta variants. Interestingly, we show thatbLF is most potent against the B.1.1.7 variant [half-maximal inhibitoryconcentration (IC50) = 3.7 microg/mL], suggesting that this strain relies onentry mechanisms that are strongly inhibited by bLF. We also show that one of themajor proteolysis products of bLF, lactoferricin B 17-41, has a modestanti-SARS-CoV-2 activity that could add to the clinical significance of thisprotein for SARS-CoV-2 treatment as lactoferricin is released by pepsin duringdigestion. Finally, we show that custom chewable lactoferrin tablets formulatedin dextrose or sorbitol have equivalent potency to unformulated samples andprovide an option for future human clinical trials. Lactoferrin's broadinhibition of SARS-CoV-2 variants in conjunction with the low cost and ease ofproduction make this an exciting clinical candidate for treatment or preventionof SARS-CoV-2 in the future.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 proteases Mpro and PLpro are promising targets for antiviral drugdevelopment. In this study, we present an antiviral screening strategy involving a novel in-cell protease assay, antiviral and biochemical activity assessments,as well as structural determinations for rapid identification of proteaseinhibitors with low cytotoxicity. We identified eight compounds withanti-SARS-CoV-2 activity from a library of 64 repurposed drugs and modeled atprotease active sites by in silico docking. We demonstrate that Sitagliptin andDaclatasvir inhibit PLpro, and MG-101, Lycorine HCl, and Nelfinavir mesylateinhibit Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. The X-ray crystal structure of Mpro in complex withMG-101 shows a covalent bond formation between the inhibitor and the active site Cys145 residue indicating its mechanism of inhibition is by blocking thesubstrate binding at the active site. Thus, we provide methods for rapid andeffective screening and development of inhibitors for blocking virus polyprotein processing as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. Additionally, we show that the combinedinhibition of Mpro and PLpro is more effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 and thedelta variant.

TI  - Unlike Chloroquine, Mefloquine Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Infection in PhysiologicallyRelevant Cells.
LID - 374 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14020374 [doi]
AB  - Despite the development of specific therapies against severe acute respiratorycoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the continuous investigation of the mechanism ofaction of clinically approved drugs could provide new information on thedruggable steps of virus-host interaction. For example, chloroquine(CQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) lacks in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 inTMPRSS2-expressing cells, such as human pneumocyte cell line Calu-3, andlikewise, failed to show clinical benefit in the Solidarity and Recovery clinicaltrials. Another antimalarial drug, mefloquine, which is not a 4-aminoquinolinelike CQ/HCQ, has emerged as a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiviral in vitro andhas also been previously repurposed for respiratory diseases. Here, weinvestigated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of action of mefloquine in cellsrelevant for the physiopathology of COVID-19, such as Calu-3 cells (thatrecapitulate type II pneumocytes) and monocytes. Molecular pathways modulated by mefloquine were assessed by differential expression analysis, and confirmed bybiological assays. A PBPK model was developed to assess mefloquine's optimaldoses for achieving therapeutic concentrations. Mefloquine inhibited SARS-CoV-2replication in Calu-3, with an EC50 of 1.2 microM and EC90 of 5.3 microM. Itreduced SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in monocytes and prevented virus-inducedenhancement of IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Mefloquine reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry andsynergized with Remdesivir. Mefloquine's pharmacological parameters areconsistent with its plasma exposure in humans and its tissue-to-plasma predicted coefficient points suggesting that mefloquine may accumulate in the lungs.Altogether, our data indicate that mefloquine's chemical structure couldrepresent an orally available host-acting agent to inhibit virus entry.

LID - 10.3390/pathogens11020259 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is accountable forthe protracted COVID-19 pandemic. Its high transmission rate and pathogenicityled to health emergencies and economic crisis. Recent studies pertaining to theunderstanding of the molecular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited theindispensable role of ion channels in viral infection inside the host. Moreover, machine learning (ML)-based algorithms are providing a higher accuracy forhost-SARS-CoV-2 protein-protein interactions (PPIs). In this study, PPIs ofSARS-CoV-2 proteins with human ion channels (HICs) were trained on the PPI-MetaGOalgorithm. PPI networks (PPINs) and a signaling pathway map of HICs withSARS-CoV-2 proteins were generated. Additionally, various U.S. food and drugadministration (FDA)-approved drugs interacting with the potential HICs wereidentified. The PPIs were predicted with 82.71% accuracy, 84.09% precision,84.09% sensitivity, 0.89 AUC-ROC, 65.17% Matthews correlation coefficient score(MCC) and 84.09% F1 score. Several host pathways were found to be altered,including calcium signaling and taste transduction pathway. Potential HICs could serve as an initial set to the experimentalists for further validation. The studyalso reinforces the drug repurposing approach for the development of hostdirected antiviral drugs that may provide a better therapeutic managementstrategy for infection caused by SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Leukotrienes are important pro-inflammatory lipid mediators derived from thearachidonic acid metabolism. In particular, cysteinyl leukotrienes, namely LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 are involved in many of the principal features of asthma, whilemore recently they have also been implicated in cardiovascular diseases. COVID-19is characterized by an overwhelming state of inflammation, sometimes resulting inan acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, severe COVID-19 patientspresent an endothelial cell damage characterized by ahyperinflammatory/procoagulant state and a widespread thrombotic disease.Leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as montelukast, have long been proven tohave an efficacy in asthma, while more recently they have been suggested to have a protective role also in cardiovascular diseases. As elevated levels of LTE4have been detected in bronchoalveolar lavage of COVID-19 patients, andmontelukast, in addition to its anti-inflammatory properties, has been suggested to have a protective role in cardiovascular diseases, we decided to investigatewhether this drug could also affect the platelet activation characteristic ofCOVID-19 syndrome. In this contribution, we demonstrate that montelukast inhibitsplatelet activation induced by plasma from COVID-19 patients by preventing thesurface expression of tissue factor (TF) and P-selectin, reducing the formationof circulating monocyte- and granulocyte-platelet aggregates, and, finally, incompletely inhibiting the release of TF(pos)-circulating microvesicles. Thesedata suggest the repurposing of montelukast as a possible auxiliary treatment forCOVID-19 syndrome.

AB  - The sudden outbreak and worldwide spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic pushed thescientific community to find fast solutions to cope with the health emergency.COVID-19 complexity, in terms of clinical outcomes, severity, and response totherapy suggested the use of multifactorial strategies, characteristic of thenetwork medicine, to approach the study of the pathobiology. Proteomics andinteractomics especially allow to generate datasets that, reduced and representedin the forms of networks, can be analyzed with the tools of systems biology tounveil specific pathways central to virus-human host interaction. Moreover,artificial intelligence tools can be implemented for the identification ofdruggable targets and drug repurposing. In this review article, we provide anoverview of the results obtained so far, from a systems biology perspective, inthe understanding of COVID-19 pathobiology and virus-host interactions, and inthe development of disease classifiers and tools for drug repurposing.

LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10020333 [doi]
AB  - In the current era of a pandemic, infections of COVID-19 and Tuberculosis (TB)enhance the detrimental effects of both diseases in suffering individuals. Theresistance mechanisms evolving in Mycobacterium tuberculosis are limiting theefficiency of current therapeutic measures and pressurizing the stressed medical infrastructures. The bacterial efflux pumps enable the development of resistance against recently approved drugs such as bedaquiline and clofazimine.Consequently, the MmpS5-MmpL5 protein system was selected because of its role in efflux pumping of anti-TB drugs. The MmpS5-MmpL5 systems of Mycobacteriumsmegmatis were modelled and the virtual screening was performed using an ASINEXlibrary of 5968 anti-bacterial compounds. The inhibitors with the highest bindingaffinities and QSAR based highest predicted inhibitory concentration wereselected. The MmpS5-MmpL5 associated systems with BDE_26593610 and BDD_27860195showed highest inhibitory parameters. These were subjected to 100 ns MolecularDynamics simulations and provided the validation regarding the interactionstudies. The in vitro studies demonstrated that the BDE_26593610 and BDD_27860195can be considered as active inhibitors for M. smegmatis MmpS5-MmpL5. The outcomesof this study can be utilized in other experimentation aimed at drug design anddiscovery against the drug resistance strains of M. tuberculosis.

AB  - At the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak (end 2019 - 2020), therapeutictreatments based on approved drugs have been the fastest approaches to combat thenew coronavirus pandemic. Nowadays several vaccines are available. However, theworldwide vaccination program is going to take a long time and its success willdepend on the vaccine public's acceptance. Therefore, outside of vaccination, therepurposing of existing antiviral, anti-inflammatory and other types of drugs,have been considered an alternative medical strategy for the COVI-19 infection.Due to the broad clinical potential of the drugs, but also to their possible sideeffects, analytical methods are needed to monitor the drug concentrations inbiological fluids and pharmaceutical products. This review deals with analytical methods developed in the period 2015 - July 2021 to detect potential drugs that, according to a literature survey, have been taken into consideration for thetreatment of COVID-19. The drugs considered here have been selected on the basis of the number of articles published in the period January 2020-July 2021, usingthe combination of the keywords: COVID-19 and drugs or SARS-CoV-2 and drugs. Asection is also devoted to monoclonal antibodies. Over the period considered, theanalytical methods have been employed in a variety of real samples, such as body fluids (plasma, blood and urine), pharmaceutical products, environmental matricesand food.

TI  - Preparing for the next COVID: Deep Reinforcement Learning trained ArtificialIntelligence discovery of multi-modal immunomodulatory control of systemicinflammation in the absence of effective anti-microbials.
LID - 2022.02.17.480940 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2022.02.17.480940 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite a great deal of interest in the application of artificialintelligence (AI) to sepsis/critical illness, most current approaches are limitedin their potential impact: prediction models do not (and cannot) address the lackof effective therapeutics and current approaches to enhancing the treatment ofsepsis focus on optimizing the application of existing interventions, and thuscannot address the development of new treatment options/modalities. The inabilityto test new therapeutic applications was highlighted by the generallyunsatisfactory results from drug repurposing efforts in COVID-19. HYPOTHESIS:Addressing this challenge requires the application of simulation-based,model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in a fashion akin to training thegame-playing AIs. We have previously demonstrated the potential of this method inthe context of bacterial sepsis in which the microbial infection is responsive toantibiotic therapy. The current work addresses the control problem ofmulti-modal, adaptive immunomodulation in the circumstance where there is noeffective anti-pathogen therapy (e.g., in a novel viral pandemic or in the faceof resistant microbes). METHODS: This is a proof-of-concept study that determinesthe controllability of sepsis without the ability to pharmacologically suppressthe pathogen. We use as a surrogate system a previously validated agent-basedmodel, the Innate Immune Response Agent-based Model (IIRABM), for controldiscovery using DRL. The DRL algorithm 'trains' an AI on simulations of infectionwhere both the control and observation spaces are limited to operating upon thedefined immune mediators included in the IIRABM (a total of 11). Policies werelearned using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient approach, with the objectivefunction being a return to baseline system health. RESULTS: DRL trained an AIpolicy that improved system mortality from 85% to 10.4%. Control actions affectedevery one of the 11 targetable cytokines and could be divided into those withstatic/unchanging controls and those with variable/adaptive controls. Adaptivecontrols primarily targeted 3 different aspects of the immune response: 2 (nd)order pro-inflammation governing TH1/TH2 balance, primary anti-inflammation, and inflammatory cell proliferation. DISCUSSION: The current treatment of sepsis ishampered by limitations in therapeutic options able to affect the biology ofsepsis. This is heightened in circumstances where no effective antimicrobialsexist, as was the case for COVID-19. Current AI methods are intrinsically unable to address this problem; doing so requires training AIs in contexts that fullyrepresent the counterfactual space of potential treatments. The synthetic dataneeded for this task is only possible through the use of high-resolution,mechanism-based simulations. Finally, being able to treat sepsis will require areorientation as to the sensing and actuating requirements needed to developthese simulations and bring them to the bedside.

AB  - The clinical, social, and economic impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) pandemic, originated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have motivated a massive search and investment to find treatmentsfor this new disease. Repurposing drugs has been an appealing strategy for therapid translation of in vitro and ex vivo drug discovery to the clinic. Severalrepurposed drugs have been assessed clinically, but no effective repurposedantiviral has been identified so far. Of note, no effective treatments forCOVID-19 or for any other viral disease have been found by repurposing drugsidentified through hypothesis-free screens. Here, I discuss whether drugrepurposing is the best strategy for developing effective therapies to eradicate COVID-19 and other viral human infections.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: During the evolution of the novel severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, several drug candidates have been proposedfor repositioning towards a quest for more effective treatments. METHODOLOGY: We reviewed recent literature (Pubmed, Google, Clinicaltrials.gov), as of the middleof May 2021, for evidence regarding the potential benefit frompoly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase inhibitors and vascular endothelial growth factorblockade in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: poly(ADP-ribose)-polymeraseinhibitors have been suggested as potential agents against coronavirus disease2019 (COVID-19) by a variety of mechanisms. vascular endothelial growthfactor-associated vascular permeability is implicated with increased vascularleakage and pulmonary oedema. Thus, anti-angiogenesis factors, such asbevacizumab are being investigated in critically ill COVID-19 patients.CONCLUSIONS: The synergistic potential of these two classes of inhibitors insevere COVID-19 management could be beneficial. Further research should becarried out in order to support this hypothesis.

AB  - Complex glycans decorate viral surface proteins and play a critical role invirus-host interactions. Viral surface glycans shield vulnerable protein epitopesfrom host immunity yet can also present distinct "glycoepitopes" that can betargeted by host antibodies such as the potent anti-HIV antibody 2G12 that binds high-mannose glycans on gp120. Two recent publications demonstrate 2G12 bindingto high mannose glycans on SARS-CoV-2 and select Influenza A (Flu) H3N2 viruses. Previously, our lab observed 2G12 binding and functional inhibition of a range ofFlu viruses that include H3N2 and H1N1 lineages. In this manuscript, we presentthese data alongside structural analyses to offer an expanded picture of 2G12-Fluinteractions. Further, based on the remarkable breadth of 2G12 N-glycanrecognition and the structural factors promoting glycoprotein oligomannosylation,we hypothesize that 2G12 glycoepitopes can be defined from protein structurealone according to N-glycan site topology. We develop a model describing 2G12glycoepitopes based on N-glycan site topology, and apply the model to identifyviruses within the Protein Data Bank presenting putative 2G12 glycoepitopes for2G12 repurposing toward analytical, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is the causative viral pathogen driving the COVID-19 pandemic thatprompted an immediate global response to the development of vaccines andantiviral therapeutics. For antiviral therapeutics, drug repurposing allowed for rapid movement of existing clinical candidates and therapies into human clinical trials to be tested as COVID-19 therapies. One effective antiviral treatmentstrategy used early in symptom onset is to prevent viral entry. SARS-CoV-2 entersACE2-expressing cells when the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein onthe surface of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 followed by cleavage at two cut sites on the spike protein. TMPRSS2 has a protease domain capable of cleaving the two cut sites; therefore, a molecule capable of inhibiting the protease activity ofTMPRSS2 could be a valuable antiviral therapy. Initially, we used a fluorogenichigh-throughput screening assay for the biochemical screening of 6030 compoundsin NCATS annotated libraries. Then, we developed an orthogonal biochemical assay that uses mass spectrometry detection of product formation to ensure that hitsfrom the primary screen are not assay artifacts from the fluorescent detection ofproduct formation. Finally, we assessed the hits from the biochemical screeningin a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped particle entry assay. Of the six moleculesadvanced for further studies, two are approved drugs in Japan (camostat andnafamostat), two have entered clinical trials (PCI-27483 and otamixaban), whilethe other two molecules are peptidomimetic inhibitors of TMPRSS2 taken from theliterature that have not advanced into clinical trials (compounds 92 and 114).This work demonstrates a suite of assays for the discovery and development of newinhibitors of TMPRSS2.

AB  - For the last two years, the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to bringconsternation on most of the world. According to recent WHO estimates, there havebeen more than 5.6 million deaths worldwide. The virus continues to evolve allover the world, thus requiring both vigilance and the necessity to find anddevelop a variety of therapeutic treatments, including the identification ofspecific antiviral drugs. Multiple studies have confirmed that SARS-CoV-2utilizes its membrane-bound spike protein to recognize humanangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Thus, preventing spike-ACE2 interactions is a potentially viable strategy for COVID-19 treatment as it would block thevirus from binding and entering into a host cell. This work aims to identifypotential drugs using an in silico approach. Molecular docking was carried out onboth approved drugs and substances previously tested in vivo. This step wasfollowed by a more detailed analysis of selected ligands by molecular dynamicssimulations to identify the best molecules that thwart the ability of the virusto interact with the ACE2 receptor. Because the SARS-CoV-2 virus evolves rapidly due to a plethora of immunocompromised hosts, the compounds were tested againstfive different known lineages. As a result, we could identify substances thatwork well on individual lineages and those showing broader efficacy. The mostpromising candidates among the currently used drugs were zafirlukast andsimeprevir with an average binding affinity of -22 kcal/mol for spike proteinsoriginating from various lineages. The first compound is a leukotriene receptorantagonist that is used to treat asthma, while the latter is a protease inhibitorused for hepatitis C treatment. From among the in vivo tested substances thatconcurrently exhibit promising free energy of binding and ADME parameters(indicating a possible oral administration) we selected the compoundBDBM50136234. In conclusion, these molecules are worth exploring further by invitro and in vivo studies against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed healthcare systems globally to a breaking point.The urgent need for effective and affordable COVID-19 treatments calls forrepurposing combinations of approved drugs. The challenge is to identify whichcombinations are likely to be most effective and at what stages of the disease.Here, we present the first disease-stage executable signalling network model ofSARS-CoV-2-host interactions used to predict effective repurposed drugcombinations for treating early- and late stage severe disease. Using ourexecutable model, we performed in silico screening of 9870 pairs of 140 potentialtargets and have identified nine new drug combinations. Camostat and Apilimodwere predicted to be the most promising combination in effectively supressingviral replication in the early stages of severe disease and were validatedexperimentally in human Caco-2 cells. Our study further demonstrates the power ofexecutable mechanistic modelling to enable rapid pre-clinical evaluation ofcombination therapies tailored to disease progression. It also presents a novelresource and expandable model system that can respond to further needs in thepandemic.

AB  - Viral infections pose a persistent threat to human health. The relentlessepidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) hasbecome a global health problem, with millions of infections and fatalities sofar. Traditional approaches such as random screening and optimization of leadcompounds by organic synthesis have become extremely resource- andtime-consuming. Various modern innovative methods or integrated paradigms are nowbeing applied to drug discovery for significant resistance in order to simplifythe drug process. This review provides an overview of newly emerging antiviralstrategies, including proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC), ribonucleasetargeting chimera (RIBOTAC), targeted covalent inhibitors, topology-matchingdesign and antiviral drug delivery system. This article is dedicated to Prof. Dr.Erik De Clercq, an internationally renowned expert in the antiviral drug researchfield, on the occasion of his 80th anniversary.

TI  - Naphthoquine: A Potent Broad-Spectrum Anti-Coronavirus Drug In Vitro.
LID - 712 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27030712 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 has spread around the world and caused serious public health and social problems. Although several vaccines have been authorized for emergency use, neweffective antiviral drugs are still needed. Some repurposed drugs includingChloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir were immediately used to treatCOVID-19 after the pandemic. However, the therapeutic effects of these drugs havenot been fully demonstrated in clinical studies. In this paper, we found anantimalarial drug, Naphthoquine, showed good broad-spectrum anti-coronavirusactivity. Naphthoquineinhibited HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 replicationin vitro, with IC50 = 2.05 +/- 1.44 muM, 5.83 +/- 0.74 muM, and 2.01 +/- 0.38microM, respectively. Time-of-addition assay was also performed to explore atwhich stage Naphthoquine functions during SARS-CoV-2 replication. The resultssuggested that Naphthoquine may influence virus entry and post-entry replication.Considering the safety of Naphthoquine was even better than that of Chloroquine, we think Naphthoquine has the potential to be used as a broad-spectrum drug forcoronavirus infection.

TI  - Airway Delivery of Hydrogel-Encapsulated Niclosamide for the Treatment ofInflammatory Airway Disease.
LID - 1085 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23031085 [doi]
AB  - Repurposing of the anthelminthic drug niclosamide was proposed as an effectivetreatment for inflammatory airway diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, andchronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Niclosamide may also be effective for the treatment of viral respiratory infections, such as SARS-CoV-2, respiratorysyncytial virus, and influenza. While systemic application of niclosamide maylead to unwanted side effects, local administration via aerosol may circumventthese problems, particularly when the drug is encapsulated into smallpolyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrospheres. In the present study, we examined whetherPEG-encapsulated niclosamide inhibits the production of mucus and affects thepro-inflammatory mediator CLCA1 in mouse airways in vivo, while effects onmucociliary clearance were assessed in excised mouse tracheas. The potential ofencapsulated niclosamide to inhibit TMEM16A whole-cell Cl(-) currents andintracellular Ca(2+) signalling was assessed in airway epithelial cells in vitro.We achieved encapsulation of niclosamide in PEG-microspheres and PEG-nanospheres (Niclo-spheres). When applied to asthmatic mice via intratracheal instillation,Niclo-spheres strongly attenuated overproduction of mucus, inhibited secretion ofthe major proinflammatory mediator CLCA1, and improved mucociliary clearance intracheas ex vivo. These effects were comparable for niclosamide encapsulated inPEG-nanospheres and PEG-microspheres. Niclo-spheres inhibited the Ca(2+)activated Cl(-) channel TMEM16A and attenuated mucus production in CFBE andCalu-3 human airway epithelial cells. Both inhibitory effects were explained by apronounced inhibition of intracellular Ca(2+) signals. The data indicate thatpoorly dissolvable compounds such as niclosamide can be encapsulated inPEG-microspheres/nanospheres and deposited locally on the airway epithelium asencapsulated drugs, which may be advantageous over systemic application.

AB  - The ongoing pandemic of Covid-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a major threat to globalpublic health, drawing attention to develop new therapeutics for treatment. Much research work is focused on identifying or repurposing new small molecules toserve as potential inhibitors by interacting with viral or host-cell moleculartargets and understanding the nature of the virus in the host cells. Identifying small molecules as potent inhibitors at an early stage is advantageous indeveloping a molecule with higher potency and then finding a lead compound forthe development of drug discovery. Small molecules can show their inhibitionproperty by targeting either the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) enzyme,papain-like protease (PL(pro)) enzyme, or helicase (Hel), or blocking the spike(S) protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. A very recentoutbreak of a new variant (B.1.617.2-termed as Delta variant) of SARS-CoV-2worldwide posed a greater challenge as it is resistant to clinically undergoingvaccine trials. Thus, the development of new drug molecules is of potentialinterest to combat SARS-CoV-2 disease, and for that, the fragment-based drugdiscovery (FBDD) approach could be one of the ways to bring out an effectivesolution. Two cysteine protease enzymes would be an attractive choice of targetfor fragment-based drug discovery to tune the molecular structure at an earlystage with suitable functionality. In this short review, the recent developmentin small molecules as inhibitors against Covid-19 is discussed, and theopportunity for FBDD is envisioned optimistically to provide an outlook regardingCovid-19 that may pave the way in the direction of the Covid-19 drug development paradigm.

PG  - 730127

AB  - In the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, drug repurposing was widely used toidentify compounds that could improve the prognosis of symptomatic patientsinfected by SARS-CoV-2. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was one of the first drugs used to treat COVID-19 due to its supposed capacity of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infectionand replication in vitro. While its efficacy is debated, HCQ has been associated with QT interval prolongation and potentially Torsades de Pointes, especially in patients predisposed to developing drug-induced Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) as silentcarriers of variants associated with congenital LQTS. If confirmed, these effectsrepresent a limitation to the at-home use of HCQ for COVID-19 infection asadequate ECG monitoring is challenging. We investigated the proarrhythmic profileof HCQ with Multi-Electrode Arrays after exposure of human induced pluripotentstem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from two healthy donors, oneasymptomatic and two symptomatic LQTS patients. We demonstrated that: I) HCQinduced a concentration-dependent Field Potential Duration (FPD) prolongation andhalted the beating at high concentration due to the combined effect of HCQ onmultiple ion currents. II) hiPSC-CMs from healthy or asymptomatic carrierstolerated higher concentrations of HCQ and showed lower susceptibility toHCQ-induced electrical abnormalities regardless of baseline FPD. These findingsagree with the clinical safety records of HCQ and demonstrated that hiPSC-CMspotentially discriminates symptomatic vs. asymptomatic mutation carriers through pharmacological interventions. Disease-specific cohorts of hiPSC-CMs may be avalid preliminary addition to assess drug safety in vulnerable populations,offering rapid preclinical results with valuable translational relevance forprecision medicine.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic hasgenerated a critical need for treatments to reduce morbidity and mortalityassociated with this disease. However, traditional drug development takes manyyears, which is not practical solution given the current pandemic. Therefore, aviable option is to repurpose existing drugs. The structural data of severalproteins vital for the virus became available shortly after the start of thepandemic. In this review, we discuss the importance of these targets and theiravailable potential inhibitors predicted by the computational approaches. Amongthe hits identified by computational approaches, 35 candidates were suggested forfurther evaluation, among which ten drugs are in clinical trials (Phase III andIV) for treating Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).

AB  - Long COVID refers to the lingering symptoms which persist or appear after theacute illness. The dominant long COVID symptoms in the two years since thepandemic began (2020-2021) have been depression, anxiety, fatigue, concentration and cognitive impairments with few reports of psychosis. Whether other symptomswill appear later on is not yet known. For example, dopamine-dependent movementdisorders generally take many years before first symptoms are seen. Post-strokedepression and anxiety may explain many of the early long COVID cases.Hemorrhagic, hypoxic and inflammatory damages of the central nervous system,unresolved systematic inflammation, metabolic impairment, cerebral vascularaccidents such as stroke, hypoxia from pulmonary damages and fibrotic changes areamong the major causes of long COVID. Glucose metabolic and hypoxic brain issues likely predispose subjects with pre-existing diabetes, cardiovascular or lungproblems to long COVID as well. Preliminary data suggest that psychotropicmedications may not be a danger but could instead be beneficial in combatingCOVID-19 infection. The same is true for diabetes medications such as metformin. Thus, a focus on sigma-1 receptor ligands and glucose metabolism is expected tobe useful for new drug development as well as the repurposing of current drugs.The reported protective effects of psychotropics and antihistamines againstCOVID-19, the earlier reports of reduced number of sigma-1 receptors inpost-mortem schizophrenic brains, with many antidepressant and antipsychoticdrugs being antihistamines with significant affinity for the sigma-1 receptor,support the role of sigma and histamine receptors in neuroinflammation and viral infections. Literature and data in all these areas are accumulating at a fastrate. We reviewed and discussed the relevant and important literature.

TI  - Repurposing Ayush-64 for COVID-19: A Computational Study Based on NetworkPharmacology and Molecular Docking.
LID - 10.2174/1386207325666220210125923 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect people's lives, thegovernment of India gave emergency use approval to the ayurvedic antimalarialdrug Ayush-64 in April 2021 to treat asymptomatic COVID-19 positive and mildCOVID-19 positive patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the therapeuticpotential of Ayush-64 to treat COVID-19 and provide a new approach forrepurposing Ayurvedic drugs. METHODS: The bioactives present in Ayush-64 werefound along with their targets, and a plantbioactive-target network was created. A protein-protein interaction network of the common targets of Ayush-64 andCOVID-19 was constructed and analyzed to find the key targets of Ayush-64associated with the disease. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis wereperformed to find COVID-19 related biological processes and pathways involved by the key targets. The key bioactives were docked with SARS-CoV-2 main protease3CL, native Human Angiotensin-converting Enzyme ACE2, Spike protein S1, andRNA-dependent RNA polymerase RdRp. RESULTS: From the 336 targets for Ayush-64, wefound 38 key targets. Functional enrichment analysis of the key targets resulted in 121 gene ontology terms and 38 pathways. When molecular docking was performed with four receptors, thirteen bioactives showed good binding affinity comparable to that of the eight drugs presently used to treat COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Network pharmacological analysis and molecular docking study of Ayush-64 revealed that itcan be recommended to treat COVID-19. Further in vitro and in vivo studies areneeded to confirm the results. The study demonstrated a new approach forrepurposing Ayurvedic drugs.

AB  - In the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), antiviral drugsare at the center of attention because of their critical role against severeacute respiratory disease syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In addition todesigning new antivirals against SARS-COV-2, a drug repurposing strategy is apractical approach for treating COVID-19. A brief insight about antivirals would help clinicians to choose the best medication for the treatment of COVID-19. Inthis review, we discuss both novel and repurposed investigational antivirals,focusing on in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trial studies.

TI  - Efficacy of Niclosamide vs Placebo in SARS-CoV-2 Respiratory Viral Clearance,Viral Shedding, and Duration of Symptoms Among Patients With Mild to ModerateCOVID-19: A Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - e2144942
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.44942 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Oral anthelmintic niclosamide has potent in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Repurposed niclosamide could be a safe and efficaciousCOVID-19 therapy. Objective: To investigate whether niclosamide decreasedSARS-CoV-2 shedding and duration of symptoms among patients with mild to moderateCOVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial enrolled individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerasechain reaction with mild to moderate symptoms of COVID. All trial participants,investigators, staff, and laboratory personnel were kept blind to participantassignments. Enrollment was among individuals reporting at Tufts Medical Centerand Wellforce Network in Massachusetts for outpatient COVID-19 testing. The trialopened to accrual on October 1, 2020; the last participant enrolled on April 20, 2021. Trial exclusion criteria included hospitalization at time of enrollment or use of any experimental treatment for COVID-19, including vaccination. Enrollmentwas stopped before attaining the planned sample size when COVID-19 diagnosesdecreased precipitously in Massachusetts. Data were analyzed from July throughSeptember 2021. Interventions: In addition to receiving current standard of care,participants were randomly assigned on a 1:1 basis to receive niclosamide 2 g by mouth daily for 7 days or identically labeled placebo at the same dosingschedule. Main Outcomes and Measures: Oropharyngeal and fecal samples wereself-collected for viral shedding measured byreverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction on days 3, 7, 10, and 14, and an additional fecal sample was collected on day 21. A telehealth platform wasdeveloped to conduct remote study visits, monitor symptoms, and coordinate samplecollection via couriers. The primary end point was the proportion of participantswith viral clearance in respiratory samples at day 3 based on theintention-to-treat sample. Mean times to viral clearance and symptom resolutionwere calculated as restricted mean survival times and accounted for censoredobservations. Results: Among 73 participants, 36 individuals were enrolled andrandomized to niclosamide and 37 individuals to placebo. Participantcharacteristics were similar across treatment groups; among 34 patients receivingplacebo and 33 patients receiving niclosamide in the intention-to-treat sample,mean (SD) age was 36.0 (13.3) years vs 36.8 (12.9) years and there were 21(61.8%) men vs 20 (60.6%) men. The overall mean (SD) age was 36.4 (13.0) years.For the primary end point, 66.67% (95% CI, 50.74% to 81.81%) of participantsreceiving niclosamide and 55.88% (95% CI, 40.27% to 72.73%) of participantsreceiving placebo had oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 clearance at day 3 (P = .37).Among 63 participants with symptoms, niclosamide did not significantly shortensymptom duration, which was 12.01 (95% CI, 8.82 to 15.2) days in the niclosamide group vs 14.61 (95% CI, 11.25 to 17.96) days in the placebo group (meandifference, -2.6 [95% CI, -7.23 to 2.03] days). Niclosamide was well-tolerated;the most commonly reported adverse events in the placebo and niclosamide groupswere headaches (11 patients [32.4%] vs 7 patients [21.2%]; P = .31) and cough (8 patients [23.5%] vs 7 patients [21.2%]; P = .82). Conclusions and Relevance: Inthis randomized clinical trial, there was no significant difference inoropharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2 at day 3 between placebo and niclosamidegroups. Confirmation in larger studies is warranted. Trial Registration:ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04399356.

AB  - Since its inception in late December 2020 in China, novel coronavirus hasaffected the global socio-economic aspect. Currently, the world is seeking safeand effective treatment measures against COVID-19 to eradicate it. Manyestablished drug molecules are tested against SARS-CoV-2 as a part of drugrepurposing where some are proved effective for symptomatic relief while some areineffective. Drug repurposing is a practical strategy for rapidly developingantiviral agents. Many drugs are presently being repurposed utilizing basicunderstanding of disease pathogenesis and drug pharmacodynamics, as well ascomputational methods. In the present situation, drug repurposing could be viewedas a new treatment option for COVID-19. Several new drug molecules and biologics are engineered against SARS-CoV-2 and are under different stages of clinicaldevelopment. A few biologics drug products are approved by USFDA for emergencyuse in the covid management. Due to continuous mutation, many of the approvedvaccines are not much efficacious to render the individual immune againstopportunistic infection of SARS-CoV-2 mutants. Hence, there is a strong need for the cogent therapeutic agent for covid management. In this review, a consolidatedsummary of the therapeutic developments against SARS-CoV-2 are depicted alongwith an overview of effective management of post COVID-19 complications.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is the causative organism for a pandemic disease with ahigh rate of infectivity and mortality. In this study, we aimed to assess theaffinity between several available small molecule and proteins, including Ablkinase inhibitors, Janus kinase inhibitor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors,RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, and Papain-like protease inhibitors,using binding simulation, to test whether they may be effective in inhibitingCOVID-19 infection through several mechanisms. The efficiency of inhibitors wasevaluated based on docking scores using AutoDock Vina software. Strongligand-protein interactions were predicted among some of these drugs, thatincluded: Imatinib, Remdesivir, and Telaprevir, and this may render thesecompounds promising candidates. Some candidate drugs might be efficient indisease control as potential inhibitors or lead compounds against the SARS-CoV-2.It is also worth highlighting the powerful immunomodulatory role of other drugs, such as Abivertinib that inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine production associatedwith cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and the progression of COVID-19 infection.The potential role of other Abl kinase inhibitors, including Imatinib in reducingSARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viral titers, immune regulatory function and thedevelopment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), indicate that thisdrug may be useful for COVID-19, as the SARS-CoV-2 genome is similar to SARS-CoV.

LID - 10.1039/d1cb00135c [doi]
AB  - Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, Covid-19 has developed into a serious threat to our health, social and economic systems. Although vaccines have beendeveloped in a tour-de-force and are now increasingly available, repurposing ofexisting drugs has been less successful. There is a clear need to develop newdrugs against SARS-CoV-2 that can also be used against future coronavirusinfections. Non-structural protein 10 (nsp10) is a conserved stimulator of twoenzymes crucial for viral replication, nsp14 and nsp16, exhibitingexoribonuclease and methyltransferase activities. Interfering with RNAproofreading or RNA cap formation represents intervention strategies to inhibitreplication. We applied fragment-based screening using nano differential scanningfluorometry and X-ray crystallography to identify ligands targeting SARS-CoV-2nsp10. We identified four fragments located in two distinct sites: one can bemodelled to where it would be located in the nsp14-nsp10 complex interface andthe other in the nsp16-nsp10 complex interface. Microscale thermophoresis (MST)experiments were used to quantify fragment affinities for nsp10. Additionally, weshowed by MST that the interaction by nsp14 and 10 is weak and thereby thatcomplex formation could be disrupted by small molecules. The fragments will serveas starting points for the development of more potent analogues using fragmentgrowing techniques and structure-based drug design.

AB  - The current novel corona virus illness (COVID-19) is a developing viral diseasethat was discovered in 2019. There is currently no viable therapeutic strategyfor this illness management. Because traditional medication development anddiscovery has lagged behind the threat of emerging and re-emerging illnesses likeEbola, MERS-CoV, and, more recently, SARS-CoV-2. Drug developers began toconsider drug repurposing (or repositioning) as a viable option to the moretraditional drug development method. The goal of drug repurposing is to uncovernew uses for an approved or investigational medicine that aren't related to itsoriginal use. The main benefits of this strategy are that there is lessdevelopmental risk and that it takes less time because the safety andpharmacologic requirements are met. The main protease (Mpro) of corona viruses isone of the well-studied and appealing therapeutic targets. As a result, thecurrent research examines the molecular docking of Mpro (PDB ID: 5R81) conjugatedrepurposed drugs. 12,432 approved drugs were collected from ChEMBL and drugbanklibraries, and docked separately into the receptor grid created on 5R81, usingthe three phases of molecular docking including high throughput virtual screening(HTVS), standard precision (SP), and extra precision (XP). Based on dockingscores and MM-GBSA binding free energy calculation, top three drugs (kanamycin,sulfinalol and carvedilol) were chosen for further analyses for molecular dynamicsimulations.

AB  - The pandemic caused by the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has already claimedmore than 3.5 million lives. Despite the development and use of anti-COVID-19vaccines, the disease remains a major public health challenge throughout theworld. Large-scale screening of the drugs already approved for the treatment ofother viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections, as well as autoimmune,oncological, and other diseases is currently underway as part of theirrepurposing for development of effective therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2.In this work, we present the results of a phenotypic screening of libraries ofmodified heterocyclic bases and 5'-norcarbocyclic nucleoside analogs previouslysynthesized by us. We identified two leading compounds with apparent potential toinhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and EC50 values in a range of 20-70 muM. Thestructures of these compounds can be further optimized to develop an antiviraldrug.

AB  - Since Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identifiedin late 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challengedpublic health around the world. Currently, there is an urgent need to exploreantiviral therapeutic targets and effective clinical drugs. In this study, wesystematically summarized two main therapeutic strategies against COVID-19,namely drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle and SARS-CoV-2-inducedinflammation in host cells. The development of above two strategies isimplemented by repurposing drugs and exploring potential targets. A comprehensivesummary of promising drugs, especially cytokine inhibitors, and traditionalChinese medicine (TCM), provides recommendations for clinicians as evidence-basedmedicine in the actual clinical COVID-19 treatment. Considering the emergingSARS-CoV-2 variants greatly impact the effectiveness of drugs and vaccines, wereviewed the appearance and details of SARS-CoV-2 variants for furtherperspectives in drug design, which brings updating clues to develop therapeuticalagents against the variants. Based on this, the development of broadly antiviral drugs, combined with immunomodulatory, or holistic therapy in the host, is prior to being considered for therapeutic interventions on mutant strains ofSARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it is highly acclaimed the requirements of the concertedefforts from multi-disciplinary basic studies and clinical trials, which improvesthe accurate treatment of COVID-19 and optimizes the contingency measures toemerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

AB  - Drug-repurposing has been instrumental to identify drugs preventing SARS-CoV-2replication or attenuating the disease course of COVID-19. Here, we identifythrough structure-based drug-repurposing a dual-purpose inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2infection and of IL-6 production by immune cells. We created a computationalstructure model of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike 1protein, and used this model for insilico screening against a library of 6171molecularly defined binding-sites from drug molecules. Molecular dynamicssimulation of candidate molecules with high RBD binding-scores in dockinganalysis predicted montelukast, an antagonist of thecysteinyl-leukotriene-receptor, to disturb the RBD structure, and infectionexperiments demonstrated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection, although montelukastbinding was outside the ACE2-binding site. Molecular dynamics simulation ofSARS-CoV-2 variant RBDs correctly predicted interference of montelukast withinfection by the beta but not the more infectious alpha variant. With distinctbinding sites for RBD and the leukotriene receptor, montelukast also preventedSARS-CoV-2-induced IL-6 release from immune cells. The inhibition of SARS-CoV-2infection through a molecule binding distal to the ACE-binding site of the RBDpoints towards an allosteric mechanism that is not conserved in the moreinfectious alpha and delta SARS-CoV-2 variants.

AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world's population by causingchanges in behavior, such as social distancing, masking, restricting people'smovement, and evaluating existing medication as potential therapies. Manypre-existing medications such as tocilizumab, ivermectin, colchicine, interferon,and steroids have been evaluated for being repurposed to use for the treatment ofCOVID-19. None of these agents have been effective except for steroids and, to a lesser degree, tocilizumab. Ivermectin has been one of the suggested repurposedmedications which exhibit an in vitro inhibitory activity on SARS-CoV-2replication. The most recommended dose of ivermectin for the treatment ofCOVID-19 is 150-200 microg/kg twice daily. As ivermectin adoption for COVID-19increased, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning on its useduring the pandemic. However, the drug remains of interest to clinicians and has shown some promise in observational studies. This narrative reviews thetoxicological profile and some potential therapeutic effects of ivermectin. Basedon the current dose recommendation, ivermectin appears to be safe with minimumside effects. However, serious questions remain about the effectiveness of thisdrug in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

TI  - Does metformin affect outcomes in COVID-19 patients with new or pre-existingdiabetes mellitus? A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 2642-2656
LID - 10.1111/bcp.15258 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health emergency and patients withdiabetes mellitus (DM) are disproportionately affected, exhibiting more severeoutcomes. Recent studies have shown that metformin is associated with improvedoutcomes in patients with COVID-19 and DM and may be a potential candidate fordrug repurposing. We aimed to investigate the effects of metformin on outcomes inpatients with COVID-19 and DM. METHODS: Databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web ofScience, EMBASE, Clinicaltrials.gov and Cochrane library) were searched up to 10 April 2021 for studies reporting data on metformin use in COVID-19 patients with DM. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Certainty of evidence was rated using the GRADE approach. The primary outcome was mortalityreported as odds ratio (OR). A random-effects meta-analysis was carried out onboth unadjusted and adjusted ORs. This study is registered with PROSPERO,CRD42020221842. RESULTS: In total, 2 916 231 patients from 32 cohort studies wereincluded in the quantitative and qualitative synthesis. The meta-analysis showed that metformin was significantly associated with lower mortality in COVID-19patients with DM in both unadjusted (OR 0.61 [95% confidence interval:0.53-0.71], P < .00001, I(2) = 70%) and adjusted (OR 0.78 [95% confidenceinterval: 0.69-0.88], P < .00001, I(2) = 67%) models. CONCLUSION: Poor outcomesin COVID-19 patients with DM can be attributed to inadequate glycaemic controland weakened immune responses. Metformin has multiple effects that can improveoutcomes in patients with DM and our findings highlight a possible role of itsuse. However, robust randomised trials are needed to thoroughly assess its use.

TI  - Systems analysis shows that thermodynamic physiological and pharmacologicalfundamentals drive COVID-19 and response to treatment.
PG  - e00922
LID - 10.1002/prp2.922 [doi]
AB  - Why a systems analysis view of this pandemic? The current pandemic has inflicted almost unimaginable grief, sorrow, loss, and terror at a global scale. One of thegreat ironies with the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly early on, is counterintuitive. The speed at which specialized basic and clinical sciences describedthe details of the damage to humans in COVID-19 disease has been impressive.Equally, the development of vaccines in an amazingly short time interval has beenextraordinary. However, what has been less well understood has been thefundamental elements that underpin the progression of COVID-19 in an individualand in populations. We have used systems analysis approaches with humanphysiology and pharmacology to explore the fundamental underpinnings of COVID-19 disease. Pharmacology powerfully captures the thermodynamic characteristics ofmolecular binding with an exogenous entity such as a virus and its consequenceson the living processes well described by human physiology. Thus, we havedocumented the passage of SARS-CoV-2 from infection of a single cell to speciesjump, to tropism, variant emergence and widespread population infection. Duringthe course of this review, the recurrent observation was the efficiency andsimplicity of one critical function of this virus. The lethality of SARS-CoV-2 isdue primarily to its ability to possess and use a variable surface for binding toa specific human target with high affinity. This binding liberates Gibbs freeenergy (GFE) such that it satisfies the criteria for thermodynamic spontaneity.Its binding is the prelude to human host cellular entry and replication by theappropriation of host cell constituent molecules that have been produced with aprior energy investment by the host cell. It is also a binding that permits viraltropism to lead to high levels of distribution across populations with newlyformed virions. This thermodynamic spontaneity is repeated endlessly as infectionof a single host cell spreads to bystander cells, to tissues, to humans in close proximity and then to global populations. The principal antagonism of thisprocess comes from SARS-CoV-2 itself, with its relentless changing of its viralsurface configuration, associated with the inevitable emergence of variantsbetter configured to resist immune sequestration and importantly with a greateraffinity for the host target and higher infectivity. The great value of thisphysiological and pharmacological perspective is that it reveals the fundamental thermodynamic underpinnings of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

TI  - The interacting physiology of COVID-19 and the renin-angiotensin-aldosteronesystem: Key agents for treatment.
PG  - e00917
LID - 10.1002/prp2.917 [doi]
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 interacting with its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),turns the host response to viral infection into a dysregulated uncontrolledinflammatory response. This is because ACE2 limits the production of the peptide angiotensin II (Ang II) and SARS-CoV-2, through the destruction of ACE2, allowsthe uncontrolled production of Ang II. Recovery from trauma requires activationof both a tissue response to injury and activation of a whole-body response tomaintain tissue perfusion. Tissue and circulating renin-angiotensin systems(RASs) play an essential role in the host response to infection and injurybecause of the actions of Ang II, mediated via its AT1 receptor. Both tissue and circulating arms of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system's (RAAS) response toinjury need to be regulated. The effects of Ang II and the steroid hormone,aldosterone, on fluid and electrolyte homeostasis and on the circulation arecontrolled by elaborate feedback networks that respond to alterations in thecomposition and volume of fluids within the circulatory system. The role of AngII in the tissue response to injury is however, controlled mainly by itsmetabolism and conversion to Ang-(1-7) by the enzyme ACE2. Ang-(1-7) has effects that are contrary to Ang II-AT1 R mediated effects. Thus, destruction of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 results in loss of control of the pro-inflammatory actions of Ang IIand tissue destruction. Therefore, it is the response of the host to SARS-CoV-2that is responsible for the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

AB  - During the last years, the progression to control malaria disease seems to beslowed and WHO (World Health Organization) reported a modeling analysis with the prediction of the increase in malaria morbidity and mortality in sub-SaharanAfrica during the COVID-19 pandemic. A rapid way to the discovery of new drugscould be carried out by performing investigations to identify drugs based onrepurposing of "old" drugs. The 5-nitrothiazole drug, Nitazoxanide was shown tobe active against intestinal protozoa, human helminths, anaerobic bacteria,viruses, etc. In this work, Nitazoxanide and analogs were prepared using twomethodologies and evaluated against P. falciparum 3D7. A bithiazole analog,showed attractive inhibitory activity with an EC50 value of 5.9 muM, lowpropensity to show toxic effect against HepG2 cells at 25 muM, and nocross-resistance with standard antimalarials.

AB  - In the current pandemic, finding an effective drug to prevent or treat theinfection is the highest priority. A rapid and safe approach to counteractCOVID-19 is in silico drug repurposing. The SARS-CoV-2 PLpro promotes viralreplication and modulates the host immune system, resulting in inhibition of the host antiviral innate immune response, and therefore is an attractive drugtarget. In this study, we used a combined in silico virtual screening forcandidates for SARS-CoV-2 PLpro protease inhibitors. We used the Informationalspectrum method applied for Small Molecules for searching the Drugbank databasefollowed by molecular docking. After in silico screening of drug space, weidentified 44 drugs as potential SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors that we propose for further experimental testing.

TI  - Evaluating the effects of sodium glucose co-transporter -2 inhibitors from arenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system perspective in patients infected withCOVID-19: contextualizing findings from the dapagliflozin in respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19 study.

AB  - Numerous studies demonstrate parallels between CVD, type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) and COVID-19 pathology, which accentuate pre-existing complications inpatients infected with COVID-19 and potentially exacerbate the infection course. Antidiabetic drugs such as sodium-glucose transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors have garnered substantial attention recently due to their efficacy in reducing theseverity of cardiorenal disease. The effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients withCOVID-19 remains unclear particularly since SGLT-2 inhibitors contribute toaltering the RAAS cascade activity, which includes ACE-2, the major cell entryreceptor for SARS-CoV2. A study, DARE-19, was carried out to unveil the effectsof SGLT-2 inhibitor treatment on comorbid disease complications and concomitantCOVID-19 outcomes and demonstrated no statistical significance. However, the needfor further studies is essential to provide conclusive clinical findings.

TI  - Co-administration of Favipiravir and the Remdesivir Metabolite GS-441524Effectively Reduces SARS-CoV-2 Replication in the Lungs of the Syrian HamsterModel.
PG  - e0304421
LID - 10.1128/mbio.03044-21 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwidesince December 2019, causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Althoughvaccines for this virus have been developed rapidly, repurposing drugs approvedto treat other diseases remains an invaluable treatment strategy. Here, weevaluated the inhibitory effects of drugs on SARS-CoV-2 replication in a hamster infection model and in in vitro assays. Favipiravir significantly suppressedvirus replication in hamster lungs. Remdesivir inhibited virus replication invitro, but was not effective in the hamster model. However, GS-441524, ametabolite of remdesivir, effectively suppressed virus replication in hamsters.Co-administration of favipiravir and GS-441524 more efficiently reduced virusload in hamster lungs than did single administration of either drug for both the prophylactic and therapeutic regimens; prophylactic co-administration alsoefficiently inhibited lung inflammation in the infected animals. Furthermore,pretreatment of hamsters with favipiravir and GS-441524 effectively protectedthem from virus transmission via respiratory droplets upon exposure to infectedhamsters. Repurposing and co-administration of antiviral drugs may help combatCOVID-19. IMPORTANCE During a pandemic, repurposing drugs that are approved forother diseases is a quick and realistic treatment option. In this study, we foundthat co-administration of favipiravir and the remdesivir metabolite GS-441524more effectively blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lungs of Syrian hamstersthan either favipiravir or GS-441524 alone as part of a prophylactic ortherapeutic regimen. Prophylactic co-administration also reduced the severity of lung inflammation. Moreover, co-administration of these drugs to naive hamstersefficiently protected them from airborne transmission of the virus from infected animals. Since both drugs are nucleotide analogs that interfere with theRNA-dependent RNA polymerases of many RNA viruses, these findings may also helpencourage co-administration of antivirals to combat future pandemics.

TI  - Andrographolide Derivatives Target the KEAP1/NRF2 Axis and Possess PotentAnti-SARS-CoV-2 Activity.
PG  - e202100732
LID - 10.1002/cmdc.202100732 [doi]
AB  - Naturally occurring compounds represent a vast pool of pharmacologically activeentities. One of such compounds is andrographolide, which is endowed with manybeneficial properties, including the activity against severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To initiate a drug repurposing or hitoptimization campaign, it is imperative to unravel the primary mechanism(s) ofthe antiviral action of andrographolide. Here, we showed by means of a reportergene assay that andrographolide exerts its anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects by inhibiting the interaction between Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) and nuclearfactor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) causing NRF2 upregulation. Moreover,we demonstrated that subtle structural modifications of andrographolide couldlead to derivatives with stronger on-target activities and improvedphysicochemical properties. Our results indicate that further optimization ofthis structural class is warranted to develop novel COVID-19 therapies.

TI  - A determination of pan-pathogen antimicrobials?
PG  - 100120
LID - 10.1016/j.medidd.2022.100120 [doi]
AB  - While antimicrobial drug development has historically mitigated infectiousdiseases that are known, COVID-19 revealed a dearth of 'in-advance' therapeutics suitable for infections by pathogens that have not yet emerged. Such drugs mustexhibit a property that is antithetical to the classical paradigm ofantimicrobial development: the ability to treat infections by any pathogen.Characterisation of such 'pan-pathogen' antimicrobials requires consolidation of drug repositioning studies, a new and growing field of drug discovery. In thisreview, a previously-established system for evaluating repositioning studies isused to highlight 4 therapeutics which exhibit pan-pathogen properties, namelyazithromycin, ivermectin, niclosamide, and nitazoxanide. Recognition of thepan-pathogen nature of these antimicrobials is the cornerstone of a novelparadigm of antimicrobial development that is not only anticipatory of pandemics and bioterrorist attacks, but cognisant of conserved anti-infective mechanismswithin the host-pathogen interactome which are only now beginning to emerge.Ultimately, the discovery of pan-pathogen antimicrobials is concomitantly thediscovery of a new class of antivirals, and begets significant implications forpandemic preparedness research in a world after COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic around the globe due to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), anew variant of the Coronavirus (CoV) family. The rapid transmission of theinfectious disease, 135,646,617 positive cases from which 2,930,732 mortalitycases were recorded until 11 April 2021. In an emergency, several existinganti-viral, anti-malarial, and anti-HIV drugs have been used on a repurposingbasis. However, without proper clinical evidence, it may create several sideeffects for the patient. Thus, recommending potential and less-toxic regimens at this emergency stage is the most crucial aspect for any physician. METHODS: Wehave hypothesized a combinatorial drug approach against COVID-19 and to selectpotential combinations from ten anti-HIV drugs and ten vitamin C derivatives weresystematically validated using advanced bioinformatic tools. Initially, thechemical structures used as ligands from PubChem and the target protein,SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB ID: 6Y84) from the protein data bank were retrievedfor this study. Further, assess the potency, toxicity, drug-ability, andpharmacokinetics profiles using several bioinformatics tools, viz., moleculardocking by the AutoDock 4.1 software with predicting activity spectra forsubstances, Molsoft, ProTox, and SwissADME tools. Molecular dynamics simulationwas also employed for most potential candidates to assess their binding stabilityusing GROMACS 5.1.4 software. RESULTS: The above computational investigationindicated that 'darunavir with L-ascorbyl-2,6-dibutyrate or ascorbicacid-2-sulfate' combinations strongly inhibit the SARS-CoV-2-main protease as apotential treatment option against COVID-19. Mostly, vitamin C derivativesenhanced the anti-COVID activity and might reduce the post-treatment side effectsof darunavir in combination. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the present work suggests thatbioinformatics tools are suitable for recognizing potential candidates in anemergency, and herein the selected 'anti-HIV-drug-vitamin c derivatives'cocktails may potential-cum-fewer toxic regimens against COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a potentially fatal disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that preferentially infects the respiratory tract. Bradykinin (BK) is a hypotensive substance thatrecently emerged as one of the mechanisms to explain COVID-19-relatedcomplications. Concerning this, in this review, we try to address the complexlink between BK and pathophysiology of COVID-19, investigating the role of thispeptide as a potential target for pharmacological modulation in the management ofSARS-CoV-2. The pathology of COVID-19 may be more a result of the BK storm thanthe cytokine storm, and which BK imbalance is a relevant factor in therespiratory disorders caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Regarding this, aninteresting point of intervention for this disease is to modulate BK signaling.Some drugs, such as icatibant, ecallantide, and noscapine, and even a humanmonoclonal antibody, lanadelumab, have been studied for their potential utilityin COVID-19 by modulating BK signaling. The interaction of the BK pathway and theinvolvement of cytokines such as IL-6 and IL1 may be key to the use of blockers, even if only as adjuvants. In fact, reduction of BK, mainly DABK, is considered arelevant strategy to improve clinical conditions of COVID-19 patients. In thiscontext, despite the current unproven clinical efficacy, drugs repurposing thatblock B1 or B2 receptor activation have gained prominence for the treatment ofCOVID-19 in the world.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causativeagent of the pandemic disease COVID-19, which is so far without efficacioustreatment. The discovery of therapy reagents for treating COVID-19 are urgentlyneeded, and the structures of the potential drug-target proteins in the virallife cycle are particularly important. SARS-CoV-2, a member of theOrthocoronavirinae subfamily containing the largest RNA genome, encodes 29proteins including nonstructural, structural and accessory proteins which areinvolved in viral adsorption, entry and uncoating, nucleic acid replication andtranscription, assembly and release, etc. These proteins individually act as apartner of the replication machinery or involved in forming the complexes withhost cellular factors to participate in the essential physiological activities.This review summarizes the representative structures and typically potentialtherapy agents that target SARS-CoV-2 or some critical proteins for viralpathogenesis, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying viral infection, prevention of infection, and treatment. Indeed, these studies open the door forCOVID therapies, leading to ways to prevent and treat COVID-19, especially,treatment of the disease caused by the viral variants are imperative.

In this work, we have applied viral pseudotyping toestablish a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 entry assay. Here, the pseudotyped particles(PP) contain SARS-CoV-2 spike in a membrane enveloping both the murine leukemiavirus (MLV) gag-pol polyprotein and luciferase reporter RNA. Upon addition of PP to HEK293-ACE2 cells, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to the ACE2 receptor on the cell surface, resulting in priming by host proteases to trigger endocytosisof these particles, and membrane fusion between the particle envelope and thecell membrane. The internalized luciferase reporter gene is then expressed incells, resulting in a luminescent readout as a surrogate for spike-mediated entryinto cells. This SARS-CoV-2 PP entry assay can be executed in a biosafety level 2containment lab for high throughput screening. From a collection of 5,158approved drugs and drug candidates, our screening efforts identified 7 activecompounds that inhibited the SARS-CoV-2-S PP entry. Of these seven, six compoundswere active against live replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus in a cytopathic effectassay. Our results demonstrated the utility of this assay in the discovery anddevelopment of SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors as well as the mechanistic study ofanti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. Additionally, particles pseudotyped with spikeproteins from SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants were prepared and used toevaluate the therapeutic effects of viral entry inhibitors.

AB  - Nucleosides and their derivatives are a well-known and well-described class ofcompounds with antiviral activity. Currently, in the era of the COVID-19pandemic, scientists are also looking for compounds not related to nucleosideswith antiviral properties. This review aims to provide an overview of selectedsynthetic antiviral agents not associated to nucleosides developed against human viruses and introduced to preclinical and clinical trials as well as drugsapproved for antiviral therapy over the last 10 years. The article describes for the first time the wide classification of such antiviral drugs and drugcandidates and briefly summarizes the biological target and clinical applicationsof the compounds. The described compounds are arranged according to the antiviralmechanism of action. Knowledge of the drug's activity toward specific moleculartargets may be the key to researching new antiviral compounds and repositioningdrugs already approved for clinical use. The paper also briefly discusses thefuture directions of antiviral therapy. The described examples of antiviralcompounds can be helpful for further drug development.

AB  - Drug repurposing can be an interesting strategy for an emergency response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, (SARS-COV-2), the causing agent of the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. For this, we applied theConnectivity Map (CMap) bioinformatic resource to identify drugs that generate,in the CMap database, gene expression profiles (GEP) that negatively correlatewith a SARS-COV-2 GEP, anticipating that these drugs could antagonize thedeleterious effects of the virus at cell, tissue or organism levels. Weidentified several anti-cancer compounds that target MDM2 in the p53 pathway orsignaling proteins: Ras, PKBbeta, Nitric Oxide synthase, Rho kinase, all involvedin the transmission of proliferative and growth signals. We hypothesized thatthese drugs could interfere with the high rate of biomass synthesis in infectedcells, a feature shared with cancer cells. Other compounds including etomoxir,triacsin-c, PTB1-IN-3, are known to modulate lipid metabolism or to favorcatabolic reactions by activating AMPK. Four different anti-inflammatorymolecules, including dexamethasone, fluorometholone and cytosporone-b, targeting the glucocorticoid receptor, cyclooxygenase, or NUR77 also came out of theanalysis. These results represent a first step in the characterization ofpotential repositioning strategies to treat SARS-COV-2.

AB  - Repurposing of authorised medicines has been under discussion for a long time.Drug repurposing is the process of identifying a new use for an existing medicinein an indication outside the scope of the original approved indication. Indeed,the COVID-19 health crisis has brought the concept to the frontline by provingthe usefulness of this practise in favour of patients for an early access totreatment. Under the umbrella of the Pharmaceutical Committee and as a result of the discussions at the European Commission Expert Group on Safe and Timely Accessto Medicines for Patients (STAMP) a virtual Repurposing Observatory Group (RepOG)was set up in 2019 to define and test the practical aspects of a pilot projectthought to provide support to "not-for-profit" stakeholders generating orgathering data for a new therapeutic use for an authorised medicine. The group's initial plan was impacted by the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and thelaunch of the pilot needed to be postponed. This article describes the progressand the activities conducted by the group during this past and yet extraordinary 2020-2021 to keep the project alive and explores on the background of this topic together with the obvious opportunities this health crisis has brought up interms of repurposing of medicines.

AB  - In the last century, the emergence of in silico tools has improved the quality ofhealthcare studies by providing high quality predictions. In the case ofCOVID-19, these tools have been advantageous for bioinformatics analysis ofSARS-CoV-2 structures, studying potential drugs and introducing drug targets,investigating the efficacy of potential natural product components at suppressingCOVID-19 infection, designing peptide-mimetic and optimizing their structure toprovide a better clinical outcome, and repurposing of the previously knowntherapeutics. These methods have also helped medical biotechnologists to designvarious vaccines; such as multi-epitope vaccines using reverse vaccinology andimmunoinformatics methods, among which some of them have showed promising resultsthrough in vitro, in vivo and clinical trial studies. Moreover, emergence ofartificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms have helped to classifythe previously known data and use them to provide precise predictions and makeplan for future of the pandemic condition. At this contemporary review, bycollecting related information from the collected literature on valuable datasources; such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, we tried to provide a brief outlook regarding the importance of in silico tools in managing different aspectsof COVID-19 pandemic infection and how these methods have been helpful tobiomedical researchers.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To clarify the work done by using AI for identifying the genomicsequences, development of drugs and vaccines for COVID-19 and to recognize theadvantages and challenges of using such technology. METHODS: A non-systematicreview was done. All articles published on Pub-Med, Medline, Google, and GoogleScholar on AI or digital health regarding genomic sequencing, drug development,and vaccines of COVID-19 were scrutinized and summarized. RESULTS: The sequenceof SARS- CoV-2 was identified with the help of AI. It can help also in the promptidentification of variants of concern (VOC) as delta strains and Omicron.Furthermore, there are many drugs applied with the help of AI. These drugsincluded Atazanavir, Remdesivir, Efavirenz, Ritonavir, and Dolutegravir, PARP1inhibitors (Olaparib and CVL218 which is Mefuparib hydrochloride), Abacavir,Roflumilast, Almitrine, and Mesylate. Many vaccines were developed utilizing the new technology of bioinformatics, databases, immune-informatics, machinelearning, and reverse vaccinology to the whole SARS-CoV-2 proteomes or thestructural proteins. Examples of these vaccines are the messenger RNA and viralvector vaccines. AI provides cost-saving and agility. However, the challenges of its usage are the difficulty of collecting data, the internal and externalvalidation, ethical consideration, therapeutic effect, and the time needed forclinical trials after drug approval. Moreover, there is a common problem in thedeep learning (DL) model which is the shortage of interpretability. CONCLUSION:The growth of AI techniques in health care opened a broad gate for discoveringthe genomic sequences of the COVID-19 virus and the VOC. AI helps also in thedevelopment of vaccines and drugs (including drug repurposing) to obtainpotential preventive and therapeutic agents for controlling the COVID-19pandemic.

AB  - Global vaccination effort and better understanding of treatment strategiesprovided a ray of hope for improvement in COVID-19 pandemic, however, in manycountries, the disease continues to collect its death toll. The major pathogenic mechanism behind severe cases associated with high mortality is the burst ofpro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-6, IFNgamma and others, resulting in multiple organ failure. Although the exact contribution of each cytokine is not clear, we provide an evidence that the central mediator of cytokine storm and itsdevastating consequences may be TNF. This cytokine is known to be involved inactivated blood clotting, lung damage, insulin resistance, heart failure, andother conditions. A number of currently available pharmaceutical agents such asmonoclonal antibodies and soluble TNF receptors can effectively prevent TNF from binding to its receptor(s). Other drugs are known to block NFkB, the major signaltransducer molecule used in TNF signaling, or to block kinases involved indownstream activation cascades. Some of these medicines have already beenselected for clinical trials, but more work is needed. A simple, rapid, andinexpensive method of directly monitoring TNF levels may be a valuable tool for atimely selection of COVID-19 patients for anti-TNF therapy.

AB  - Endemic human coronaviruses (hCoVs) 229E and OC43 cause respiratory disease with recurrent infections, while severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2spreads across the world with impact on health and societies. Here, we report an image-based multicycle infection procedure with alpha-coronavirus hCoV-229E-eGFP in an arrayed chemical library screen of 5440 clinical and preclinical compounds.Toxicity counter selection and challenge with the beta-coronaviruses OC43 andSARS-CoV-2 in tissue culture and human airway epithelial explant cultures (HAEEC)identified four FDA-approved compounds with oral availability. Methylene blue(MB, used for the treatment of methemoglobinemia), Mycophenolic acid (MPA, usedin organ transplantation) and the anti-fungal agent Posaconazole (POS) had thebroadest anti-CoV spectrum. They inhibited the shedding of SARS-CoV-2 andvariants-of-concern (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) from HAEEC in either pre- or postexposure regimens at clinically relevant concentrations. Co-treatment of culturedcells with MB and the FDA-approved SARS-CoV-2 RNA-polymerase inhibitor Remdesivirreduced the effective anti-viral concentrations of MB by 2-fold, and Remdesivirby 4 to 10-fold, indicated by BLISS independence synergy modelling. Neither MB,nor MPA, nor POS affected the cell delivery of SARS-CoV-2 or OC43 (+)sense RNA,but blocked subsequent viral RNA accumulation in cells. Unlike Remdesivir, MB,MPA or POS did not reduce the release of viral RNA in post exposure regimen, thusindicating infection inhibition at a post-replicating step as well. In summary,the data emphasize the power of unbiased, full cycle compound screens to identifyand repurpose broadly acting drugs against coronaviruses.

AB  - Nucleoside analogues are among the most successful bioactive classes of druglike compounds in pharmaceutical chemistry as they are well-known for their numerouseffective bioactivities in humans, especially as antiviral and anticancer agents.Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still untreatable, with its causing virus,the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continuing towreak havoc on the ground everywhere. This complicated international situationurged all concerned scientists, including medicinal chemists and drugdiscoverers, to search for a potent anti-COVID-19 drug. Cordycepin(3'-deoxyadenosine) is a known natural adenosine analogue of fungal origin, whichcould also be synthetically produced. This bioactive phytochemical compound ischaracterized by several proven strong pharmacological actions that mayeffectively contribute to the comprehensive treatment of COVID-19, with theantiviral activities being the leading ones. Some new studies predicted thepossible inhibitory affinities of cordycepin against the principal SARS-CoV-2protein targets (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, main protease (M(pro))enzyme, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme) based on thecomputational approach. Interestingly, the current research showed, for the firsttime, that cordycepin is able to potently inhibit the multiplication of the newresistant strains of SARS-CoV-2 with a very minute in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC50 of about 2 muM, edging over both remdesivir and its active metabolite GS-441524. The ideal pharmacophoric features of the cordycepin molecule render it a typical inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication, with its flexible structure open for mosttypes of derivatization in the future. Briefly, the current findings furthersupport and suggest the repurposing possibility of cordycepin against COVID-19and greatly encourage us to confidently and rapidly begin itspreclinical/clinical evaluations for the comprehensive treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - The sudden outbreak of the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2virus) is posing a significant threat by affecting millions of people across the globe showing mild to severe symptoms of pneumonia and acute respiratorydistress. The absence of precise information on primary transmission, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics for patients with COVID-19 makes prevention andcontrol tough. In the current scenario, only supportive treatment is available,which in turn possess a biggest challenge for scientists to develop specificdrugs and vaccines for COVID-19. Further, India, with the second largestpopulated country and fluctuating climatic conditions quarterly, has highvulnerability towards COVID-19 infection. Thus, this highlights the importance ofa better understanding of the COVID-19 infection, pathology, diagnosis and itstreatment. The present review article has been intended to discuss the COVID-19biology, mechanism of infection in humans with primary effects on pregnancy, the nervous system, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The article will alsodiscuss the drug repurposing strategy as an alternative line of treatment andclinical practices recommended by the World Health Organization and othergovernment agencies and represent the COVID-19 scenario with the Indian context.

AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to an rush to repurpose existingdrugs, although the underlying evidence base is of variable quality. Drugrepurposing is a technique by taking advantage of existing known drugs or drugcombinations to be explored in an unexpected medical scenario. Drug repurposing, hence, plays a vital role in accelerating the pre-clinical process of designingnovel drugs by saving time and cost compared to the traditional de novo drugdiscovery processes. Since drug repurposing depends on massive observed data fromexisting drugs and diseases, the tremendous growth of publicly availablelarge-scale machine learning methods supplies the state-of-the-art application ofdata science to signaling disease, medicine, therapeutics, and identifyingtargets with the least error. In this article, we introduce guidelines onstrategies and options of utilizing machine learning approaches for accelerating drug repurposing. We discuss how to employ machine learning methods in studyingprecision medicine, and as an instance, how machine learning approaches canaccelerate COVID-19 drug repurposing by developing Chinese traditional medicinetherapy. This article provides a strong reasonableness for employing machinelearning methods for drug repurposing, including during fighting for COVID-19pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is unprecedented in recent memoryowing to the non-stop escalation in number of infections and deaths in almostevery country of the world. The lack of treatment options further worsens thescenario, thereby necessitating the exploration of already existing USFDA-approved drugs for their effectiveness against COVID-19. In the presentstudy, we have performed virtual screening of nutraceuticals available fromDrugBank against 14 SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Molecular docking identified severalinhibitors, two of which, rutin and NADH, displayed strong binding affinities andinhibitory potential against SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Further normal model-basedsimulations were performed to gain insights into the conformational transitionsin proteins induced by the drugs. The computational analysis in the present studypaves the way for experimental validation and development of multi-target guided inhibitors to fight COVID-19.

TI  - Outside any therapeutic trial prescription of hydroxychloroquine for hospitalizedpatients with covid-19 during the first wave of the pandemic: A national inquiry of prescription patterns among French hospitalists.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0261843 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: During the first wave of the coronavirus-disease 2019 (covid-19)pandemic in early 2020, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was widely prescribed in lightof in vitro activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2). Our objective was to evaluate in early 2020 the rate of Frenchhospitalists declaring having prescribed HCQ to treat covid-19 patients outsideany therapeutic trial, compare the reasons and the determinants for havingprescribed HCQ or not. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A national inquiry submitted byemail from May 7 to 25, 2020, to a sample of French hospitalists: doctorsmanaging patients hospitalized for covid-19 in a French department of internalmedicine or infectious diseases and identified in the directories of Frenchhospitals or as a member of the French Infectious Diseases Society (SPILF).Primary outcome was the percentage of hospitalists declaring having prescribedHCQ to covid-19 patients. Secondary outcomes were reasons and determinants of HCQprescription. RESULTS: Among 400 (22.8%) responding hospitalists, 45.3% (95% CI, 40.4 to 50.1%) declared having prescribed HCQ to covid-19 patients. Two mainprofiles were discerned: HCQ prescribers who did not raise its efficacy as amotive, and non-prescribers who based their decision on evidence-based medicine. Multivariate analysis retained the following prescription determinants (adjusted odds ratio; 95% confidence interval): a departmental procedure for HCQprescription (8.25; 4.79 to 14.20), having prescribed other treatments outside a therapeutic trial (3.21; 1.81 to 5.71), prior HCQ prescription (2.75; 1.5 to5.03) and HCQ prescribed within the framework of a therapeutic trial (0.56; 0.33 to 0.95). CONCLUSION: Almost half of the hospitalists prescribed HCQ. Thephysician's personality (questioning or not evidence-based-medicine principles inthe context of the pandemic) and departmental therapeutic procedures were themain factors influencing HCQ prescription. Establishment of "therapeutic"procedures represents a potential means to improve the quality of therapeuticdecision-making during a pandemic.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 responsible for COVID-19remains a persistent threat to mankind, especially for the immunocompromised and elderly for which the vaccine may have limited effectiveness. Entry of SARS-CoV-2requires a high affinity interaction of the viral spike protein with the cellularreceptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Novel mutations on the spike proteincorrelate with the high transmissibility of new variants of SARS-CoV-2,highlighting the need for small molecule inhibitors of virus entry into targetcells. We report the identification of such inhibitors through a robusthigh-throughput screen testing 15,000 small molecules from unique libraries.Several leads were validated in a suite of mechanistic assays, including wholecell SARS-CoV-2 infectivity assays. The main lead compound, calpeptin, wasfurther characterized using SARS-CoV-1 and the novel SARS-CoV-2 variant entryassays, SARS-CoV-2 protease assays and molecular docking. This study revealscalpeptin as a potent and specific inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 and some variants.

AB  - In the event of an outbreak due to an emerging pathogen, time is of the essenceto contain or to mitigate the spread of the disease. Drug repositioning is one ofthe strategies that has the potential to deliver therapeutics relatively quickly.The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown that integrating critical data resources todrive drug-repositioning studies, involving host-host, host-pathogen, anddrug-target interactions, remains a time-consuming effort that translates to adelay in the development and delivery of a life-saving therapy. Here, we describea workflow we designed for a semiautomated integration of rapidly emerging datasets that can be generally adopted in a broad network pharmacology researchsetting. The workflow was used to construct a COVID-19 focused multimodal networkthat integrates 487 host-pathogen, 63278 host-host protein, and 1221 drug-target interactions. The resultant Neo4j graph database named "Neo4COVID19" is madepublicly accessible via a web interface and via API calls based on the Boltprotocol. Details for accessing the database are provided on a landing page(https://neo4covid19.ncats.io/). We believe that our Neo4COVID19 database will bea valuable asset to the research community and will catalyze the discovery oftherapeutics to fight COVID-19.

Despite the development of vaccines, insufficient protection remains a concern.Therefore, the screening of drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) is reasonable and necessary. This study utilized bioinformatics forthe selection of compounds approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration withtherapeutic potential in this setting. In addition, the inhibitory effect ofthese compounds on the enzyme activity of transmembrane protease serine 2(TMPRSS2), papain-like protease (PL(pro)), and 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) wasevaluated. Furthermore, the capability of compounds to attach to thespike-receptor-binding domain (RBD) was considered an important factor in thepresent assessment. Finally, the antiviral potency of compounds was validatedusing a plaque reduction assay. Our funnel strategy revealed that tamoxifenpossesses an anti-SARS-CoV-2 property owing to its inhibitory performance inmultiple assays. The proposed time-saving and feasible strategy may acceleratedrug screening for COVID-19 and other diseases.

AB  - Atazanavir (ATV) has already been considered as a potential repurposing drug to2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19); however, there are controversial reports on its mechanism of action and effectiveness as anti-severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Through the pre-clinical chain ofexperiments: enzymatic, molecular docking, cell-based and in vivo assays, it isdemonstrated here that both SARS-CoV-2 B.1 lineage and variant of concern gammaare susceptible to this antiretroviral. Enzymatic assays and molecular dockingcalculations showed that SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) was inhibited by ATV, with Morrison's inhibitory constant (Ki) 1.5-fold higher than GC376 (a positivecontrol) dependent of the catalytic water (H2Ocat) content. ATV was a competitiveinhibitor, increasing the M(pro)'s Michaelis-Menten (Km) more than sixfold.Cell-based assays indicated that different lineages of SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to ATV. Using oral administration of ATV in mice to reach plasmatic exposuresimilar to humans, transgenic mice expression in human angiotensin convertingenzyme 2 (K18-hACE2) were partially protected against lethal challenge withSARS-CoV-2 gamma. Moreover, less cell death and inflammation were observed in thelung from infected and treated mice. Our studies may contribute to a bettercomprehension of the M(pro)/ATV interaction, which could pave the way to thedevelopment of specific inhibitors of this viral protease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The process of drug discovery and development is expensive, complex, timeconsuming, and risky. There are different techniques involved in the process of drug development, including random screening, computational approaches,molecular manipulation, and serendipitous research. Among these methods, thecomputational approach is considered an efficient strategy to accelerate andeconomize the drug discovery process. OBJECTIVE: This approach is mainly applied in various phases of the drug discovery process, including target identification,target validation, lead identification, and lead optimization. Due to theincrease in the availability of information regarding various biological targets of different disease states, computational approaches such as molecular docking, de novo design, molecular similarity calculation, virtual screening,pharmacophore-based modeling, and pharmacophore mapping have been appliedextensively. METHODS: Various drug molecules can be designed by applyingcomputational tools to explore the drug candidates for the treatment ofCoronavirus infection. The World Health Organization announced the coronavirusdisease as COVID-19 and declared it a global pandemic on 11 February 2020.Therefore, it is thought of interest to the scientific community to applycomputational methods to design and optimize the pharmacological properties ofvarious clinically available and FDA-approved drugs such as remdesivir,ribavirin, favipiravir, oseltamivir, ritonavir, arbidol, chloroquine,hydroxychloroquine, carfilzomib, baraticinib, prulifloxacin, etc., for effective treatment of COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Further, various survey reports suggestthat extensive studies are carried out by various research communities to findout the safety and efficacy profile of these drug candidates. CONCLUSION: Thisreview is focused on the study of various aspects of these drugs related to theirtarget sites on the virus, binding interactions, physicochemical properties, etc.

AB  - Insulin resistance (IR) contributes to the pathophysiology of diabetes, dementia,viral infection, and cardiovascular disease. Drug repurposing (DR) may identifytreatments for IR; however, barriers include uncertainty whether in vitrotranscriptomic assays yield quantitative pharmacological data, or how to optimiseassay design to best reflect in vivo human disease. We developed a clinical-basedhuman tissue IR signature by combining lifestyle-mediated treatment responses(>500 human adipose and muscle biopsies) with biomarkers of disease status(fasting IR from >1200 biopsies). The assay identified a chemically diverse setof >130 positively acting compounds, highly enriched in true positives, thattargeted 73 proteins regulating IR pathways. Our multi-gene RNA assay scorereflected the quantitative pharmacological properties of a set of epidermalgrowth factor receptor-related tyrosine kinase inhibitors, providing insight intodrug target specificity; an observation supported by deep learning-basedgenome-wide predicted pharmacology. Several drugs identified are suitable forevaluation in patients, particularly those with either acute or severe chronicIR.

OAB - Developing a new drug that is both safe and effective is a complex and expensive endeavor. An alternative approach is to 'repurpose' existing, safe compounds -that is, to establish if they could treat conditions others than the ones theywere initially designed for. To achieve this, methods that can predict theactivity of thousands of established drugs are necessary. These approaches areparticularly important for conditions for which it is hard to find promisingtreatment. This includes, for instance, heart failure, dementia and otherdiseases that are linked to the activity of the hormone insulin becoming modifiedthroughout the body, a defect called insulin resistance. Unfortunately, it isdifficult to model the complex actions of insulin using cells in the lab, becausethey involve intricate networks of proteins, tissues and metabolites. Timmons et al. set out to develop a way to better assess whether a drug could be repurposed to treat insulin resistance. The aim was to build a biological signature of thedisease in multiple human tissues, as this would help to make the findings morerelevant to the clinic. This involved examining which genes were switched on oroff in thousands of tissue samples from patients with different degrees ofinsulin resistance. Importantly, some of the patients had their conditionreversed through lifestyle changes, while others did not respond well totreatment. These 'non-responders' provided crucial new clues to screen for activedrugs. Carefully piecing the data together revealed the molecules and pathwaysmost related to the severity of insulin resistance. Cross-referencing theseresults with the way existing drugs act on gene activity, highlighted 138compounds that directly bind 73 proteins responsible for regulating insulinresistance pathways. Some of the drugs identified are suitable for short-termclinical studies, and it may even be possible to rank similar compounds based on their chemical activity. Beyond giving a glimpse into the complex molecularmechanisms of insulin resistance in humans, Timmons et al. provide a freshapproach to how drugs could be repurposed, which could be adapted to otherconditions.

AB  - Drug development for specific antiviral agents against coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) is still an unmet medical need as the pandemic continues to spreadglobally. Although huge efforts for drug repurposing and compound screens havebeen put forth, only a few compounds are in late-stage clinical trials. Newapproaches and assays are needed to accelerate COVID-19 drug discovery anddevelopment. Here, we report a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energytransfer-based assay that detects the severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid protein (NP) produced in infected cells. It uses two specific anti-NP monoclonal antibodies conjugated to donor andacceptor fluorophores that produce a robust ratiometric signal for highthroughput screening of large compound collections. Using this assay, we measureda half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for remdesivir of 9.3 muM against infection with SARS-CoV-2 USA/WA1/2020 (WA-1). The assay also detected SARS-CoV-2South African (Beta, beta), Brazilian/Japanese P.1 (Gamma, gamma), andCalifornian (Epsilon, epsilon) variants of concern (VoC). Therefore, thishomogeneous SARS-CoV-2 NP detection assay can be used for accelerating leadcompound discovery for drug development and for evaluating drug efficacy against emerging SARS-CoV-2 VoC.

AB  - Massive usage of antiviral compounds during a pandemic creates an ideal groundfor emergence of resistant strains. Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of theviral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), was extensively prescribed underemergency use authorization during the first 18 months of the COVID19 pandemic,before randomized controlled trials showed poor efficacy in hospitalizedpatients. RdRp mutations conferring resistance to remdesivir are well known from in vitro studies, and the huge SARS-CoV-2 sequencing effort during the ongoingCOVID19 pandemic represents an unprecedented opportunity to assess emergence and fitness of antiviral resistance in vivo. We mined the GISAID database toextrapolate the frequency of remdesivir escape mutations. Our analysis revealsvery low levels of remdesivir resistance worldwide despite massive usage.

AB  - Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction reduces the cost and time of drugdevelopment, and plays a vital role in drug discovery. However, most of research does not fully explore the molecular structures of drug compounds in DTIprediction. To this end, we propose a deep learning model to capture themolecular structure information of drug compounds for DTI prediction. This model utilizes a transformer network incorporating multilayer graph information, which captures the features of a drug's molecular structure so that the interactionsbetween atoms of drug compounds can be explored more deeply. At the same time, a convolutional neural network is employed to capture the local residue informationin the target sequence, and effectively extract the feature information of thetarget. The experiments on the DrugBank dataset showed that the proposed modeloutperformed previous models based on the structure of target sequences. Theresults indicate that the improved transformer network fuses the featureinformation between layers in the graph convolutional neural network and extractsthe interaction data for the molecular structure. The drug repositioningexperiment on COVID-19 and Alzheimer's disease demonstrated the proposed model's ability to find therapeutic drugs in drug discovery. The code of our model isavailable at https://github.com/zhangpl109/DeepMGT-DTI.

TI  - "LONG COVID"-A hypothesis for understanding the biological basis andpharmacological treatment strategy.
PG  - e00911
LID - 10.1002/prp2.911 [doi]
AB  - Infection of humans with SARS-CoV-2 virus causes a disease known colloquially as "COVID-19" with symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia. Initialpathology is due to the virus binding to the ACE-2 protein on endothelial cellslining blood vessels and entering these cells in order to replicate. Viralreplication causes oxidative stress due to elevated levels of reactive oxygenspecies. Many (~60%) of the infected people appear to have eliminated the virusfrom their body after 28 days and resume normal activity. However, a significant proportion (~40%) experience a variety of symptoms (loss of smell and/or taste,fatigue, cough, aching pain, "brain fog," insomnia, shortness of breath, andtachycardia) after 12 weeks and are diagnosed with a syndrome named "LONG COVID."Longitudinal clinical studies in a group of subjects who were infected withSARS-CoV-2 have been compared to a non-infected matched group of subjects. Acohort of infected subjects can be identified by a battery of cytokine markers tohave persistent, low level grade of inflammation and often self-report two ormore troubling symptoms. There is no drug that will relieve their symptomseffectively. It is hypothesized that drugs that activate the intracellulartranscription factor, nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (NRF2) mayincrease the expression of enzymes to synthesize the intracellular antioxidant,glutathione that will quench free radicals causing oxidative stress. The hormone melatonin has been identified as an activator of NRF2 and a relatively safechemical for most people to ingest chronically. Thus, it is an option forconsideration of re-purposing studies in "LONG COVID" subjects experiencinginsomnia, depression, fatigue, and "brain fog" but not tachycardia. Appropriatelydesigned clinical trials are required to evaluate melatonin.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2 is a virus thatbelongs to the Coronaviridae family. This group of viruses commonly causes colds but possesses a tremendous pathogenic potential. In humans, an outbreak of SARScaused by the SARS-CoV virus was first reported in 2003, followed by 2012 whenthe Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) led to an outbreak ofMiddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Moreover, COVID-19 represents a serious socioeconomic and global health problem that has already claimed more than fourmillion lives. To date, there are only a handful of therapeutic options to combatthis disease, and only a single direct-acting antiviral, the conditionallyapproved remdesivir. Since there is an urgent need for active drugs againstSARS-CoV-2, the strategy of drug repurposing represents one of the fastest waysto achieve this goal. An in silico drug repurposing study using two methods wasconducted. A structure-based virtual screening of the FDA-approved drug database on SARS-CoV-2 main protease was performed, and the 11 highest-scoring compoundswith known 3CL(pro) activity were identified while the methodology was used toreport further 11 potential and completely novel 3CL(pro) inhibitors. Then,inverse molecular docking was performed on the entire viral protein database aswell as on the Coronaviridae family protein subset to examine the hit compoundsin detail. Instead of target fishing, inverse docking fingerprints were generatedfor each hit compound as well as for the five most frequently reported anddirect-acting repurposed drugs that served as controls. In this way, thetarget-hitting space was examined and compared and we can support the furtherbiological evaluation of all 11 newly reported hits on SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) aswell as recommend further in-depth studies on antihelminthic class membercompounds. The authors acknowledge the general usefulness of this approach for a full-fledged inverse docking fingerprint screening in the future.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been socially and economicallydevastating. Despite an unprecedented research effort and available vaccines,effective therapeutics are still missing to limit severe disease and mortality.Using high-throughput screening, we identify acriflavine (ACF) as a potentpapain-like protease (PL(pro)) inhibitor. NMR titrations and a co-crystalstructure confirm that acriflavine blocks the PL(pro) catalytic pocket in anunexpected binding mode. We show that the drug inhibits viral replication atnanomolar concentration in cellular models, in vivo in mice and ex vivo in human airway epithelia, with broad range activity against SARS-CoV-2 and otherbetacoronaviruses. Considering that acriflavine is an inexpensive drug approvedin some countries, it may be immediately tested in clinical trials and play animportant role during the current pandemic and future outbreaks.

AB  - The flavonoid silymarin extracted from the seeds of Sylibum marianum is a mixtureof 6 flavolignan isomers. The 3 more important isomers are silybin (orsilibinin), silydianin, and silychristin. Silybin is functionally the most activeof these compounds. This group of flavonoids has been extensively studied andthey have been used as hepato-protective substances for the mushroom Amanitaphalloides intoxication and mainly chronic liver diseases such as alcoholiccirrhosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver. Hepatitis C progression is not, orslightly, modified by silymarin. Recently, it has also been proposed for SARSCOVID-19 infection therapy. The biochemical and molecular mechanisms of action ofthese substances in cancer are subjects of ongoing research. Paradoxically, many of its identified actions such as antioxidant, promoter of ribosomal synthesis,and mitochondrial membrane stabilization, may seem protumoral at first sight,however, silymarin compounds have clear anticancer effects. Some of them are:decreasing migration through multiple targeting, decreasing hypoxia induciblefactor-1alpha expression, inducing apoptosis in some malignant cells, andinhibiting promitotic signaling among others. Interestingly, the antitumoralactivity of silymarin compounds is limited to malignant cells while thenonmalignant cells seem not to be affected. Furthermore, there is a long history of silymarin use in human diseases without toxicity after prolongedadministration. The ample distribution and easy accessibility to milk thistle-thesource of silymarin compounds, its over the counter availability, the fact thatit is a weed, some controversial issues regarding bioavailability, and being anutraceutical rather than a drug, has somehow led medical professionals to viewits anticancer effects with skepticism. This is a fundamental reason why it neverachieved bedside status in cancer treatment. However, in spite of all theantitumoral effects, silymarin actually has dual effects and in some cases suchas pancreatic cancer it can promote stemness. This review deals with recentinvestigations to elucidate the molecular actions of this flavonoid in cancer,and to consider the possibility of repurposing it. Particular attention isdedicated to silymarin's dual role in cancer and to some controversies of itsreal effectiveness.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic,encodes two proteases, 3CLpro and PLpro, two of the main antiviral researchtargets. Here we provide an overview of the structures and functions of 3CLproand PLpro and examine strategies of structure-based drug designing and drugrepurposing against these proteases. Rational structure-based drug design enablesthe generation of potent and target-specific antivirals. Drug repurposing offers an attractive prospect with an accelerated turnaround. Thus far, several proteaseinhibitors have been identified, and some candidates are undergoing trials thatmay well prove to be effective antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Cysteamine with In Vitro Antiviral Activity and Immunomodulatory Effects Has the Potential to Be a Repurposing Drug Candidate for COVID-19 Therapy.
LID - 52 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11010052 [doi]
AB  - The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), needs better treatmentoptions both at antiviral and anti-inflammatory levels. It has been demonstrated that the aminothiol cysteamine, an already human applied drug, and its disulfide product of oxidation, cystamine, have anti-infective properties targetingviruses, bacteria, and parasites. To determine whether these compounds exertantiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2, we used different in vitro viral infectedcell-based assays. Moreover, since cysteamine has also immune-modulatoryactivity, we investigated its ability to modulate SARS-CoV-2-specific immuneresponse in vitro in blood samples from COVID-19 patients. We found thatcysteamine and cystamine decreased SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) inVero E6 cells. Interestingly, the antiviral action was independent of thetreatment time respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, cysteamine andcystamine significantly decreased viral production in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells.Finally, cysteamine and cystamine have an anti-inflammatory effect, as theysignificantly decrease the SARS-CoV-2 specific IFN-gamma production in vitro inblood samples from COVID-19 patients. Overall, our findings suggest thatcysteamine and cystamine exert direct antiviral actions against SARS-CoV-2 andhave in vitro immunomodulatory effects, thus providing a rational to test thesecompounds as a novel therapy for COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several reports linked the use of repurposed drugs such ashydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and favipiravir withQT interval prolongation in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Little is knownabout the risk factors for QT interval prolongation in this population. We soughtto describe the prevalence and identify the main risk factors associated withclinically significant corrected QT (QTc) prolongation in this population.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of critically ill patients whowere admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU), had at least oneelectrocardiogram performed during their ICU stay, and tested positive forSARs-CoV-2. Clinically significant QTc interval prolongation was defined as QTc>500 milliseconds (ms). RESULTS: Out of the 111 critically ill patients withSARS-CoV-2 infection, QTc was significantly prolonged in 47 cases (42.3%).Patients with a clinically significant QTc prolongation had significantly higher proportions of history of cardiac diseases/surgery (22 [46.8%] vs. 10 [15.6%], P < .001), hypokalemia (10 [21.3] vs. 5 [7.8%], P = .04), and male gender (95% vs. 82.8%, P = .036) than patients with QTc </=500 ms, respectively. A total of 46patients (41.4%) received HCQ, 28 (25.2%) received lopinavir/ritonavir, and 5(4.5%) received azithromycin. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showedthat a history of cardiac disease was the only independent factor associated withclinically significant QTc prolongation (P = .004 for the likelihood-ratio test).CONCLUSION: The prevalence of clinically significant QTc prolongation incritically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was high and independent ofdrugs used. Larger prospective observational studies are warranted to elucidateindependent risk factors associated with clinically significant QTc prolongation in this study population.

AB  - Malaria, a disease caused by the protozoan parasites Plasmodium spp., is stillcausing serious problems in endemic regions in the world. Although the WHOrecommends artemisinin combination therapies for the treatment of malariapatients, the emergence of artemisinin-resistant parasites has become a seriousissue and underscores the need for the development of new antimalarial drugs. On the other hand, new and re-emergences of infectious diseases, such as theinfluenza pandemic, Ebola virus disease, and COVID-19, are urging the world todevelop effective chemotherapeutic agents against the causative viruses, whichare not achieved to the desired level yet. In this review article, we describeexisting drugs which are active against both Plasmodium spp. and microorganismsincluding viruses, bacteria, and fungi. We also focus on the current knowledgeabout the mechanism of actions of these drugs. Our major aims of this article areto describe examples of drugs that kill both Plasmodium parasites and othermicrobes and to provide valuable information to help find new ideas fordeveloping novel drugs, rather than merely augmenting already existing drugrepurposing efforts.

LID - 10.1007/s11030-021-10355-8 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by novel severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Its main protease, 3C-like protease (3CLpro), is an attractive target for drug design, due to its importance in virusreplication. The analysis of the radial distribution function of 159 3CLprostructures reveals a high similarity index. A study of the catalytic pocket of3CLpro with bound inhibitors reveals that the influence of the inhibitors islocal, perturbing dominantly only residues in the active pocket. A machinelearning based model with high predictive ability against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro isdesigned and validated. The model is used to perform a drug-repurposing study,with the main aim to identify existing drugs with the highest 3CLpro inhibitionpower. Among antiviral agents, lopinavir, idoxuridine, paritaprevir, andfavipiravir showed the highest inhibition potential. Enzyme - ligand interactionsas a key ingredient for successful drug design.

AB  - High concentrations of ivermectin demonstrated antiviral activity againstSARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of high-dose ivermectin in reducing viral load in individuals with earlySARS-CoV-2 infection. This was a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase II,dose-finding, proof-of-concept clinical trial. Participants were adults recently diagnosed with asymptomatic/oligosymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Exclusioncriteria were: pregnant or lactating women; CNS disease; dialysis; severe medicalcondition with prognosis <6 months; warfarin treatment; and antiviral/chloroquinephosphate/hydroxychloroquine treatment. Participants were assigned (ratio 1:1:1) according to a randomised permuted block procedure to one of the following arms: placebo (arm A); single-dose ivermectin 600 mug/kg plus placebo for 5 days (armB); and single-dose ivermectin 1200 mug/kg for 5 days (arm C). Primary outcomeswere serious adverse drug reactions (SADRs) and change in viral load at Day 7.From 31 July 2020 to 26 May 2021, 32 participants were randomised to arm A, 29 toarm B and 32 to arm C. Recruitment was stopped on 10 June because of a dramaticdrop in cases. The safety analysis included 89 participants and the change inviral load was calculated in 87 participants. No SADRs were registered. Mean(S.D.) log10 viral load reduction was 2.9 (1.6) in arm C, 2.5 (2.2) in arm B and 2.0 (2.1) in arm A, with no significant differences (P = 0.099 and 0.122 for Cvs. A and B vs. A, respectively). High-dose ivermectin was safe but did not show efficacy to reduce viral load.

AB  - The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the novelsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) accelerates thediscovery of prophylactic and therapeutic drugs for persons infected with thevirus. Drug repurposing for the COVID-19 pandemic has received particularattention. Increasing clinical data suggest that antidepressant use inearly-stage subjects with COVID-19 might be associated with a reduced risk ofintubation or death. Among the antidepressants, fluvoxamine is the mostattractive drug for mild to moderate subjects with COVID-19. In this article, we review the mechanisms of action (i.e., serotonin transporter, sigma-1 receptor,and acid sphingomyelinase) of fluvoxamine for COVID-19. Furthermore, we discuss apossible link between maternal COVID-19 infection and a risk for neuropsychiatricdisorders (i.e., autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia) in offspring.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted almost every part of human life worldwide, posing a massive threat to human health. The lack of time for new drugdiscovery and the urgent need for rapid disease control to reduce mortality have led to a search for quick and effective alternatives to novel therapeutics, forexample drug repurposing. To identify potentially repurposable drugs, we employeda systematic approach to mine candidates from U.S. FDA-approved drugs andpreclinical small-molecule compounds by integrating gene expression perturbation data for chemicals from the Library of Integrated Network-Based CellularSignatures project with a publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasetfrom patients with mild and severe COVID-19 (GEO: GSE145926, public dataavailable and accessed on 22 April 2020). We identified 281 FDA-approved drugsthat have the potential to be effective against severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, 16 of which are currently undergoingclinical trials to evaluate their efficacy against COVID-19. We experimentallytested and demonstrated the inhibitory effects of tyrphostin-AG-1478 andbrefeldin-a, two chemical inhibitors of glycosylation (a post-translationalmodification) on the replication of the single-stranded ribonucleic acid (ssRNA) virus influenza A virus as well as on the transcription and translation of hostcell cytokines and their regulators (IFNs and ISGs). In conclusion, we haveidentified and experimentally validated repurposable anti-SARS-CoV-2 and IAVdrugs using a systems biology approach, which may have the potential for treatingthese viral infections and their complications (sepsis).

AB  - Cytokine release syndrome, a prominent mechanism of morbidity and mortality inpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can cause multiple bodilyreactions, including excessive release of proinflammatory mediators, with tumornecrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) being the most prevalent cytokine combined withpersistently elevated D-dimer levels that are indicative of potential thrombotic events, low levels of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) generation, and progressivedecrease in hemoglobin production. In our argument, the conceptual repurposing ofhydroxyurea (HU) for managing COVID-19 can provide a promising therapeutic optionoriginating from a rich history of investigational antiviral activity. HU as aproposed supportive therapeutic agent for treating COVID-19 can exemplify asuccessful remedial choice through its anti-inflammatory activity along with anintrinsic propensity to control the circulatory levels of key cytokines includingTNF-alpha. HU has the ability to undergo in vivo NO conversion acting as NO donortogether with being a prominent inducer of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production. Thecombination of the mentioned two properties allows HU to possess evidentcapability of protecting against thrombotic events by controlling D-dimer levels.The implication of our hypothetical argument sheds light on the curativepotential of HU, which can be strategically harnessed against COVID-19.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the emerging severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has set off a global pandemic.There is an urgent unmet need for safe, affordable, and effective therapeuticsagainst COVID-19. In this regard, drug repurposing is considered as a promisingapproach. We assessed the compounds that affect the endosomal acidic environment by applying human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)- expressing cellsinfected with a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-pseudotyped HIV reporter virus andidentified that obatoclax resulted in the strongest inhibition of Sprotein-mediated virus entry. The potent antiviral activity of obatoclax atnanomolar concentrations was confirmed in different human lung and intestinalcells infected with the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype system as well as clinical virusisolates. Furthermore, we uncovered that obatoclax executes a double-strikeagainst SARS-CoV-2. It prevented SARS-CoV-2 entry by blocking endocytosis ofvirions through diminished endosomal acidification and the correspondinginhibition of the enzymatic activity of the endosomal cysteine protease cathepsinL. Additionally, obatoclax impaired the SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated membrane fusion by targeting the MCL-1 protein and reducing furin protease activity. In accordancewith these overarching mechanisms, obatoclax blocked the virus entry mediated by different S proteins derived from several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern such as,Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Delta (B.1.617.2). Taken together, ourresults identified obatoclax as a novel effective antiviral compound that keepsSARS-CoV-2 at bay by blocking both endocytosis and membrane fusion. Our datasuggested that obatoclax should be further explored as a clinical drug for thetreatment of COVID-19.

TI  - Machine Learning Based Prediction of COVID-19 Mortality Suggests Repositioning ofAnticancer Drug for Treating Severe Cases.
PG  - 100020
LID - 10.1016/j.ailsci.2021.100020 [doi]
AB  - Despite available vaccinations COVID-19 case numbers around the world are stillgrowing, and effective medications against severe cases are lacking. In thiswork, we developed a machine learning model which predicts mortality for COVID-19patients using data from the multi-center 'Lean European Open Survey onSARS-CoV-2-infected patients' (LEOSS) observational study (>100 active sites inEurope, primarily in Germany), resulting into an AUC of almost 80%. We showedthat molecular mechanisms related to dementia, one of the relevant predictors in our model, intersect with those associated to COVID-19. Most notably, among thesemolecules was tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), a protein that has been patented as drug target in Alzheimer's Disease but also genetically associated with severeCOVID-19 outcomes. We experimentally verified that anti-cancer drugs Sorafeniband Regorafenib showed a clear anti-cytopathic effect in Caco2 and VERO-E6 cells and can thus be regarded as potential treatments against COVID-19. Altogether,our work demonstrates that interpretation of machine learning based risk modelscan point towards drug targets and new treatment options, which are stronglyneeded for COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, only dexamethasone, tocilizumab, and sarilumab haveconclusively been shown to reduce mortality of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19). Safe and effective treatments will need to be both affordable andwidely available globally to be used alongside vaccination programs. Thisanalysis will estimate and compare potential generic minimum costs of a selectionof approved COVID-19 drug candidates with available international list prices.METHODS: We searched for repurposed drugs that have been approved by at least oneof the World Health Organization, US Food and Drug Administration, or the United Kingdom National Institute of Health and Care Excellence organizations or atleast given emergency use authorization or recommended for off-labelprescription. Drug prices were searched for dexamethasone, budesonide,baricitinib, tocilizumab, casirivimab, and imdevimab, and sarilumab, using activepharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) data extracted from global shipping records.This was compared with national pricing data from a range of low-, medium-, andhigh-income countries. Annual API export volumes from India were used to estimatethe current availability of each drug. RESULTS: Repurposed therapies can begenerically manufactured for some treatments at very low per-course costs,ranging from US $2.58 for intravenous (IV) dexamethasone (or US $0.19 orally) andUS $4.34 for inhaled budesonide. No export price data were available forbaricitinib, tocilizumab, casirivimab, and imdevimab, or sarilumab, but coursesof these treatments have higher prices, ranging from US $6.67 for baricitinib to US $875.5 for sarilumab. When comparing international list prices, we found wide variations between countries. CONCLUSIONS: Successful management of COVID-19 willrequire equitable access to treatment for all populations, not just those able topay high prices. Dexamethasone and budesonide are widely available andaffordable, whereas monoclonal antibodies and IV treatment courses are moreexpensive.

AB  - Effective treatment strategies for severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remainscarce. Hydrolysis of membrane-embedded, inert sphingomyelin by stress responsivesphingomyelinases is a hallmark of adaptive responses and cellular repair. Asdemonstrated in experimental and observational clinical studies, the transientand stress-triggered release of a sphingomyelinase, SMPD1, into circulation andsubsequent ceramide generation provides a promising target for FDA-approveddrugs. Here, we report the activation of sphingomyelinase-ceramide pathway in 23 intensive care patients with severe COVID-19. We observed an increase ofcirculating activity of sphingomyelinase with subsequent derangement ofsphingolipids in serum lipoproteins and from red blood cells (RBC). Consistentwith increased ceramide levels derived from the inert membrane constituentsphingomyelin, increased activity of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) accuratelydistinguished the patient cohort undergoing intensive care from healthy controls.Positive correlational analyses with biomarkers of severe clinical phenotypesupport the concept of an essential pathophysiological role of ASM in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as of a promising role for functional inhibition with anti-inflammatory agents in SARS-CoV-2 infection as also proposed inindependent observational studies. We conclude that large-sized multicenter,interventional trials are now needed to evaluate the potential benefit offunctional inhibition of this sphingomyelinase in critically ill patients withCOVID-19.

AB  - With numerous infections and fatalities, COVID-19 has wreaked havoc around theglobe. The main protease (Mpro), which cleaves the polyprotein to formnon-structural proteins, thereby helping in the replication of SARS-CoV-2,appears as an attractive target for antiviral therapeutics. As FDA-approved drugshave shown effectiveness in targeting Mpro in previous SARS-CoV(s), moleculardocking and virtual screening of existing antiviral, antimalarial, and proteaseinhibitor drugs were carried out against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Among 53 shortlisteddrugs with binding energies lower than that of the crystal-bound inhibitoralpha-ketoamide 13 b (-6.7 kcal/mol), velpatasvir, glecaprevir, grazoprevir,baloxavir marboxil, danoprevir, nelfinavir, and indinavir (-9.1 to -7.5 kcal/mol)were the most significant on the list (hereafter referred to as the 53-list).Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed the stability of their Mprocomplexes, with the MMPBSA binding free energy (DeltaGbind) ranging between -124 kJ/mol (glecaprevir) and -28.2 kJ/mol (velpatasvir). Despite having the lowestinitial binding energy, velpatasvir exhibited the highest DeltaGbind value forescaping the catalytic site during the MD simulations, indicating its reducedefficacy, as observed experimentally. Available inhibition assay data adequately substantiated the computational forecast. Glecaprevir and nelfinavir (DeltaGbind = -95.4 kJ/mol) appear to be the most effective antiviral drugs against Mpro.Furthermore, the remaining FDA drugs on the 53-list can be worth considering,since some have already demonstrated antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.Hence, theoretical pKi (Ki = inhibitor constant) values for all 53 drugs wereprovided. Notably, DeltaGbind directly correlates with the average distance ofthe drugs from the His41-Cys145 catalytic dyad of Mpro, providing a roadmap forrapid screening and improving the inhibitor design against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

AB  - In December 2019, a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) started spreading worldwide causing the coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) pandemic. The hyperactivation of the immune system has been proposedto account for disease severity and death in COVID-19 patients. Despite severalapproaches having been tested, no therapeutic protocol has been approved. Giventhat Cyclosporine A (CsA) is well-known to exert a strong antiviral activity onseveral viral strains and an anti-inflammatory role in different organs withrelevant benefits in diverse pathological contexts, we tested its effects onSARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells. We found that treatment with CsA eitherbefore or after infection of CaLu3 cells by three SARS-CoV-2 variants: (i)reduces the expression of both viral RNA and proteins in infected cells; (ii)decreases the number of progeny virions released by infected cells; (iii) dampensthe virus-triggered synthesis of cytokines (including IL-6, IL-8, IL1alpha andTNF-alpha) that are involved in cytokine storm in patients. Altogether, thesedata provide a rationale for CsA repositioning for the treatment of severeCOVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 is the most recently identified memberof the betacoronavirus genus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Repurposingof available drugs has been a "quick and dirty" approach to try to reducemortality and severe symptoms in affected patients initially, and can stillrepresent an undeniable and valuable approach to face COVID-19 as the continuous appearance and rapid diffusion of more "aggressive"/transmissible variants,capable of eluding antibody neutralization, challenges the effectiveness of some anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Here, we tested a known antiviral and anti-inflammatorydrug, Cyclosporine A (CsA), and found that it dampens viral infection andcytokine release from lung cells upon exposure to three different SARS-CoV-2variants. Knock down of the main intracellular target of CsA, Cyclophilin A, doesnot phenocopy the drug inhibition of viral infection. Altogether, these findings shed new light on the cellular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide therationale for CsA repositioning to treat severe COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Although a certain level of efficacy and safety of several vaccine productsagainst severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) have beenestablished, unmet medical needs for orally active small molecule therapeuticdrugs are still very high. As a key drug target molecule, SARS-CoV-2 mainprotease (M(pro)) is focused and large number of in-silico screenings, a part of which were supported by artificial intelligence (AI), have been conducted toidentify M(pro) inhibitors both through drug repurposing and drug discoveryapproaches. In the many drug-repurposing studies, docking simulation-basedtechnologies have been mainly employed and contributed to the identification ofseveral M(pro) binders. On the other hand, because AI-guided INTerprotein'sEngine for New Drug Design (AI-guided INTENDD), an AI-supported activityprediction system for small molecules, enables to propose the potential bindersby proprietary AI scores but not docking scores, it was expected to identifynovel potential M(pro) binders from FDA-approved drugs. As a result, we selected 20 potential M(pro) binders using AI-guided INTENDD, of which 13 drugs showedM(pro)-binding signal by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) method. Six (6)compounds among the 13 positive drugs were identified for the first time by thepresent study. Furthermore, it was verified that vorapaxar bound to M(pro) with aKd value of 27 microM by SPR method and inhibited virus replication in SARS-CoV-2infected cells with an EC50 value of 11 microM.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.Sarma.

AB  - Although months have passed since WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, only alimited number of clinically effective drugs are available, and the developmentof drugs to treat COVID-19 has become an urgent issue worldwide. The pace of new research on COVID-19 is extremely high and it is impossible to read every report.In order to tackle these problems, we leveraged our artificial intelligence (AI) system, Concept Encoder, to accelerate the process of drug repositioning. ConceptEncoder is a patented AI system based on natural language processing technologyand by deeply learning papers on COVID-19, the system identified a large group ofgenes implicated in COVID-19 pathogenesis. The AI system then generated amolecular linkage map for COVID-19, connecting the genes by learning themolecular relationship comprehensively. By thoroughly reviewing the resulting mapand list of the genes with rankings, we found potential key players for diseaseprogression and existing drugs that might improve COVID-19 survival. Here, wefocus on potential targets and discuss the perspective of our approach.

AB  - Eritoran (E5564) is Eisai's in-house discovered and developed investigationalToll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonist created with natural product organicsynthesis technology. It is a structural analogue of Lipid A, which is anactivator of endotoxins of bacteria. It has been previously observed to be safein 14 clinical studies including a large Phase 3 randomized trial in severesepsis. In order to evaluate therapeutic efficacy by eritoran, we areparticipating in the international network REMAP-CAP-COVID (Randomized, Embedded,Multi-factorial, Adaptive Platform-Community Acquired Pneumonia COVID) which aimsfor novel coronavirus medicine development through drug repurposing, and began aninternational collaborative clinical trial in October 2020 which is designatedfor confirmed novel coronavirus patients who are hospitalized and are in aprogressing disease state. It is hoped that through suppressing the most upstreamTLR4 activity which controls production of multiple cytokines by eritoran, thecytokine storm in patients can be suppressed and pneumonia can thus be prevented from becoming severe. On the other hand, E6011 is the only humanizedanti-fractalkine (FKN) monoclonal antibody in the world created by KAN ResearchInstitute. E6011 inhibits the tight binding of CD16-positive monocytes (a cellpopulation that highly expresses the FKN receptor CX3CR1) to vascular endothelialcells, which are important for the local inflammatory response. This is expected to suppress the formation and exacerbation of vasculopathy in COVID-19.

AB  - The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spread throughout the world and caused apandemic with COVID-19, an infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. Even today, anincrease in the number of cases has also been observed in Japan. Since the drugs used in drug repositioning have already been tested for safety andpharmacokinetics in humans, it is possible to skip some development tests, andsince the manufacturing method of the drug has already been established, it ispossible to shorten the development period and reduce R&D costs. Therefore, thedrug repositioning method is one of the methods that should be tried in order to achieve the initial control of a pandemic. In Japan, it has been announced thatresearch and development using drug repositioning has been conducted to date. Thefollowing are some of the candidates that have already been identified asCOVID-19 therapeutic agents in Japan and are expected to be identified in thefuture.

AB  - Commonly prescribed antidepressants may be associated with protection againstsevere COVID-19. The mechanism of their action in this context, however, remains unknown. Here, I investigated the effect of an antidepressant drug fluvoxamine onmembrane trafficking of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its cell host receptorACE2 in HEK293T cells. A sub-therapeutic concentration (80 nM) of fluvoxaminerapidly upregulated fluid-phase endocytosis, resulting in enhanced accumulationof the spike-ACE2 complex in enlarged early endosomes. Diversion of endosomaltrafficking provides a simple cell biological mechanism consistent with theprotective effect of antidepressants against COVID-19, highlighting theirtherapeutic and prophylactic potential.

AB  - Tauopathy is a term that has been used to represent a pathological condition inwhich hyperphosphorylated tau protein aggregates in neurons and glia whichresults in neurodegeneration, synapse loss and dysfunction and cognitiveimpairments. Recently, drug repositioning strategy (DRS) becomes a promisingfield and an alternative approach to advancing new treatments from actuallydeveloped and FDA approved drugs for an indication other than the indication itwas originally intended for. This paradigm provides an advantage because thesafety of the candidate compound has already been established, which abolishesthe need for further preclinical safety testing and thus substantially reducesthe time and cost involved in progressing of clinical trials. In the presentreview, we focused on correlation between tauopathy and common diseases as type 2diabetes mellitus and the global virus COVID-19 and how tau pathology canaggravate development of these diseases in addition to how these diseases can be a risk factor for development of tauopathy. Moreover, correlation betweenCOVID-19 and type 2 diabetes mellitus was also discussed. Therefore,repositioning of a drug in the daily clinical practice of patients to manage orprevent two or more diseases at the same time with lower side effects anddrug-drug interactions is a promising idea. This review concluded the results of pre-clinical and clinical studies applied on antidiabetics, COVID-19 medications,antihypertensives, antidepressants and cholesterol lowering drugs for possibledrug repositioning for management of tauopathy.

AB  - On 4th November 2021, the first oral antiviral drug for COVID-19, molnupiravir(Lagevrio(R)), received full regulatory approval from the Medicines andHealthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK. Molnupiravir is an orallybioavailable antiviral drug for use at home when a SARS-CoV-2 test is positive.On 22nd December 2022, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for the oral antiviral drug, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid(R)) for adults and childrenwith mild and moderate COVID-19 at increased risk of progression to severeCOVID-19. These regulatory drug approvals come at a crucial time when newvariants of concern of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are spreading rapidly. Although theFDA approved remdesivir (Veklury(R)) on 22nd October 2020 for use in adults andchildren for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization, its use hasbeen limited by the requirement for intravenous administration in a healthcarefacility. The four FDA-approved therapeutic neutralizing monoclonal antibodies,imdevimab, bamlanivimab, etesevimab, and casirivimab are costly and also require medically-supervised intravenous administration. The availability of effective,low-cost oral antiviral drugs available in a community setting that can be usedat an early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection is now a priority in controllingCOVID-19. An increasing number of repurposed antiviral drugs are currently under investigation or in the early stages of regulatory approval. This Editorial aims to present an update on the current status of orally bioavailable antiviral drug treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-coronavirus (CoV)-2 has made millions of deaths since 2019. Although a variety of computational methods have been proposedto repurpose drugs for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections, it is still a challenging task for new viruses, as there are no verified virus-drug associations (VDAs)between them and existing drugs. To efficiently solve the cold-start problemposed by new viruses, a novel constrained multi-view nonnegative matrixfactorization (CMNMF) model is designed by jointly utilizing multiple sources of biological information. With the CMNMF model, the similarities of drugs andviruses can be preserved from their own perspectives when they are projected ontoa unified latent feature space. Based on the CMNMF model, we propose a deeplearning method, namely VDA-DLCMNMF, for repurposing drugs against new viruses.VDA-DLCMNMF first initializes the node representations of drugs and viruses with their corresponding latent feature vectors to avoid a random initialization andthen applies graph convolutional network to optimize their representations. Givenan arbitrary drug, its probability of being associated with a new virus iscomputed according to their representations. To evaluate the performance ofVDA-DLCMNMF, we have conducted a series of experiments on three VDA datasetscreated for SARS-CoV-2. Experimental results demonstrate that the promisingprediction accuracy of VDA-DLCMNMF. Moreover, incorporating the CMNMF model into deep learning gains new insight into the drug repurposing for SARS-CoV-2, as the results of molecular docking experiments reveal that four antiviral drugsidentified by VDA-DLCMNMF have the potential ability to treat SARS-CoV-2infections.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global crisis. Clinicalcandidates with high efficacy, ready availability, and that do not developresistance are in urgent need. Despite that screening to repurpose clinicallyapproved drugs has provided a variety of hits shown to be effective againstSARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture, there are few confirmed antiviralcandidates in vivo. In this study, 94 compounds showing high antiviral activityagainst SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells were identified from 2,580 FDA-approvedsmall-molecule drugs. Among them, 24 compounds with low cytotoxicity wereselected, and of these, 17 compounds also effectively suppressed SARS-CoV-2infection in HeLa cells transduced with human ACE2. Six compounds disturbmultiple processes of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Their prophylactic efficacieswere determined in vivo using Syrian hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2infection. Seven compounds reduced weight loss and promoted weight regain ofhamsters infected not only with the original strain but also the D614G variant.Except for cisatracurium, six compounds reduced hamster pulmonary viral load, andIL-6 and TNF-alpha mRNA when assayed at 4 d postinfection. In particular,sertraline, salinomycin, and gilteritinib showed similar protective effects asremdesivir in vivo and did not induce antiviral drug resistance after 10 serialpassages of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, suggesting promising application for COVID-19treatment.

AB  - The pharmacological arsenal against the COVID-19 pandemic is largely based ongeneric anti-inflammatory strategies or poorly scalable solutions. Moreover, asthe ongoing vaccination campaign is rolling slower than wished, affordable andeffective therapeutics are needed. To this end, there is increasing attentiontoward computational methods for drug repositioning and de novo drug design.Here, multiple data-driven computational approaches are systematically integratedto perform a virtual screening and prioritize candidate drugs for the treatmentof COVID-19. From the list of prioritized drugs, a subset of representativecandidates to test in human cells is selected. Two compounds,7-hydroxystaurosporine and bafetinib, show synergistic antiviral effects in vitroand strongly inhibit viral-induced syncytia formation. Moreover, since existingdrug repositioning methods provide limited usable information for de novo drugdesign, the relevant chemical substructures of the identified drugs are extractedto provide a chemical vocabulary that may help to design new effective drugs.

LID - 10.3390/v13122379 [doi]
AB  - Modulation of the antiviral innate immune response has been proposed as aputative cellular target for the development of novel pan-viral therapeuticstrategies. The Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription(JAK-STAT) pathway is especially relevant due to its essential role in theregulation of local and systemic inflammation in response to viral infections,being, therefore, a putative therapeutic target. Here, we review theextraordinary diversity of strategies that viruses have evolved to interfere withJAK-STAT signaling, stressing the relevance of this pathway as a putativeantiviral target. Moreover, due to the recent remarkable progress on thedevelopment of novel JAK inhibitors (JAKi), the current knowledge on its efficacyagainst distinct viral infections is also discussed. JAKi have a proven efficacy against a broad spectrum of disorders and exhibit safety profiles comparable tobiologics, therefore representing good candidates for drug repurposingstrategies, including viral infections.

TI  - Understanding COVID-19 Pathogenesis: A Drug-Repurposing Effort to Disrupt Nsp-1Binding to Export Machinery Receptor Complex.
LID - 1634 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens10121634 [doi]
AB  - Non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) is a virulence factor found in all betacoronaviruses (b-CoVs). Recent studies have shown that Nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 virusinteracts with the nuclear export receptor complex, which includes nuclear RNAexport factor 1 (NXF1) and nuclear transport factor 2-like export factor 1(NXT1). The NXF1-NXT1 complex plays a crucial role in the transport of hostmessenger RNA (mRNA). Nsp1 interferes with the proper binding of NXF1 to mRNAexport adaptors and its docking to the nuclear pore complex. We propose thatdrugs targeting the binding surface between Nsp1 and NXF1-NXT1 may be a usefulstrategy to restore host antiviral gene expression. Exploring this strategy formsthe main goals of this paper. Crystal structures of Nsp1 and the heterodimer ofNXF1-NXT1 have been determined. We modeled the docking of Nsp1 to the NXF1-NXT1complex, and discovered repurposed drugs that may interfere with this binding. Toour knowledge, this is the first attempt at drug-repurposing of this complex. We used structural analysis to screen 1993 FDA-approved drugs for docking to theNXF1-NXT1 complex. The top hit was ganirelix, with a docking score of -14.49.Ganirelix competitively antagonizes the gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor(GNRHR) on pituitary gonadotrophs, and induces rapid, reversible suppression ofgonadotropin secretion. The conformations of Nsp1 and GNRHR make it unlikely thatthey interact with each other. Additional drug leads were inferred from thestructural analysis of this complex, which are discussed in the paper. Thesedrugs offer several options for therapeutically blocking Nsp1 binding toNFX1-NXT1, which may normalize nuclear export in COVID-19 infection.

TI  - Drug Repurposing Using Modularity Clustering in Drug-Drug Similarity NetworksBased on Drug-Gene Interactions.
LID - 2117 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics13122117 [doi]
AB  - Drug repurposing is a valuable alternative to traditional drug design based onthe assumption that medicines have multiple functions. Computer-based techniques use ever-growing drug databases to uncover new drug repurposing hints, whichrequire further validation with in vitro and in vivo experiments. Indeed, such a scientific undertaking can be particularly effective in the case of rare diseases(resources for developing new drugs are scarce) and new diseases such as COVID-19(designing new drugs require too much time). This paper introduces a new,completely automated computational drug repurposing pipeline based on drug-geneinteraction data. We obtained drug-gene interaction data from an earlier version of DrugBank, built a drug-gene interaction network, and projected it as adrug-drug similarity network (DDSN). We then clustered DDSN by optimizingmodularity resolution, used the ATC codes distribution within each cluster toidentify potential drug repurposing candidates, and verified repurposing hintswith the latest DrugBank ATC codes. Finally, using the best modularity resolutionfound with our method, we applied our pipeline to the latest DrugBank drug-geneinteraction data to generate a comprehensive drug repurposing hint list.

AB  - COVID-19 has spread swiftly throughout the world posing a global healthemergency. The significant numbers of deaths attributed to this pandemic haveresearchers battling to understand this new, dangerous virus. Researchers arelooking to find possible treatment regimens and develop effective therapies. Thisstudy aims to provide an overview of published scientific information onpotential treatments, emphasizing angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2)inhibitors as one of the most important drug targets. SARS-CoV-2 receptor-bindingdomain (RBD); as a viral attachment or entry inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2, human recombinant soluble ACE2; as a genetically modified soluble form of ACE2 tocompete with membrane-bound ACE2, and microRNAs (miRNAs); as a negative regulatorof the expression of ACE2/TMPRSS2 to inhibit SARS-CoV2 entry into cells, are the potential therapeutic approaches discussed thoroughly in this article. Thisreview provides the groundwork for the ongoing development of therapeutic agents and effective treatments against SARS-COV-2.

TI  - Pandemic drugs at pandemic speed: infrastructure for accelerating COVID-19 drugdiscovery with hybrid machine learning- and physics-based simulations onhigh-performance computers.
PG  - 20210018
LID - 10.1098/rsfs.2021.0018 [doi]
AB  - The race to meet the challenges of the global pandemic has served as a reminderthat the existing drug discovery process is expensive, inefficient and slow.There is a major bottleneck screening the vast number of potential smallmolecules to shortlist lead compounds for antiviral drug development. Newopportunities to accelerate drug discovery lie at the interface between machinelearning methods, in this case, developed for linear accelerators, andphysics-based methods. The two in silico methods, each have their own advantages and limitations which, interestingly, complement each other. Here, we present an innovative infrastructural development that combines both approaches toaccelerate drug discovery. The scale of the potential resulting workflow is such that it is dependent on supercomputing to achieve extremely high throughput. Wehave demonstrated the viability of this workflow for the study of inhibitors for four COVID-19 target proteins and our ability to perform the required large-scalecalculations to identify lead antiviral compounds through repurposing on avariety of supercomputers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interferon-beta is an attractive drug for repurposing and use in the treatment of COVID-19, based on its in vitro antiviral activity and theencouraging results from clinical trials. The aim of this study was to analyzethe impact of early interferon-beta treatment in patients admitted with COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: This post hoc analysis of aCOVID-19@Spain multicenter cohort included 3808 consecutive adult patientshospitalized with COVID-19 from 1 January to 17 March 2020. The primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality, and the main exposure of interest wassubcutaneous administration of interferon-beta, defined as early if started </= 3days from admission. Multivariate logistic and Cox regression analyses wereconducted to identify the associations of different variables with receivingearly interferon-beta therapy and to assess its impact on 30-day mortality. Apropensity score was calculated and used to both control for confounders andperform a matched cohort analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 683 patients (17.9%)received early interferon-beta therapy. These patients were more severely ill.Adjusted HR for mortality with early interferon-beta was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.82-1.30)in the overall cohort, 0.96 (0.82-1.13) in the PS-matched subcohort, and 0.89(0.60-1.32) when interferon-beta treatment was analyzed as a time-dependentvariable. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter cohort of admitted COVID-19 patients, receiving early interferon-beta therapy after hospital admission did not show an association with lower mortality. Whether interferon-beta might be useful in the earlier stages of the disease or specific subgroups of patients requires further research.

AB  - Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, pharmaceutical companies and researchgroups have focused on the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs againstSARS-CoV-2. Here, we apply a drug repurposing strategy to identify drugcandidates that are able to block the entrance of the virus into human cells. By combining virtual screening with in vitro pseudovirus assays and antiviral assaysin Human Lung Tissue (HLT) cells, we identify entrectinib as a potentialantiviral drug.

Of these tested PPs,11 drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration showed an excellentbinding affinity to the catalytic residues of 3CL(pro) of His41 and Cys145:uracil mustard, cytarabine, floxuridine, trifluridine, stavudine, lamivudine,zalcitabine, telbivudine, tipiracil, citicoline, and uridine triacetate. Theirpercentage of residues involved in binding at the active sites ranged from 56 to 100, and their binding affinities were in the range from -4.6 +/- 0.14 to -7.0+/- 0.19 kcal/mol. The molecular dynamics as determined by a 200 ns simulationrun of solvated docked complexes confirmed the stability of PP conformations thatbound to the catalytic dyad and the active sites of 3CL(pro). The free energy of binding also demonstrates the stability of the PP-3CL(pro) complexes. Citicoline and uridine triacetate showed free binding energies of -25.53 and -7.07 kcal/mol,respectively. Therefore, I recommend that they be repurposed for the fightagainst COVID-19, following proper experimental and clinical validation.

AB  - Inflammation involves a complex biological response of the body tissues todamaging stimuli. When dysregulated, inflammation led by biomolecular mediatorssuch as caspase-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) can play adetrimental role in the progression of different medical conditions such ascancer, neurological disorders, autoimmune diseases, and cytokine storms causedby viral infections such as COVID-19. Computational approaches can accelerate thesearch for dual-target drugs able to simultaneously inhibit the aforementionedproteins, enabling the discovery of wide-spectrum anti-inflammatory agents. This work reports the first multicondition model based on quantitativestructure-activity relationships and a multilayer perceptron neural network(mtc-QSAR-MLP) for the virtual screening of agency-regulated chemicals asversatile anti-inflammatory therapeutics. The mtc-QSAR-MLP model displayedaccuracy higher than 88%, and was interpreted from a physicochemical andstructural point of view. When using the mtc-QSAR-MLP model as a virtualscreening tool, we could identify several agency-regulated chemicals as dualinhibitors of caspase-1 and TNF-alpha, and the experimental information laterretrieved from the scientific literature converged with our computationalresults. This study supports the capabilities of our mtc-QSAR-MLP model inanti-inflammatory therapy with direct applications to current health issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral respiratory diseasethat spreads rapidly, reaching pandemic status, causing the collapse of numerous health systems, and a strong economic and social impact. The treatment so far hasnot been well established and there are several clinical trials testing knowndrugs that have antiviral activity, due to the urgency that the global situation imposes. Drugs with specific mechanisms of action can take years to bediscovered, while vaccines may also take a long time to be widely distributedwhile new virus variants emerge. Thus, drug repositioning has been shown to be a good strategy for defining new therapeutic approaches. Studies of the effect ofenriched heparin in the replication of severe acute respiratory syndromeCoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro assays justify the advance for clinicaltests. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A phase I/II triple-blind parallel clinical trialwill be conducted. Fifty participants with radiological diagnosis of grade IIApneumonia will be selected, which will be allocated in 2 arms. Participantsallocated in Group 1 (placebo) will receive nebulized 0.9% saline. Participantsallocated in Group 2 (intervention) will receive nebulized enriched heparin (2.5 mg/mL 0.9% saline). Both groups will receive the respective solutions on a 4/4hour basis, for 7 days. The main outcomes of interest will be safety (absence of serious adverse events) and efficacy (measured by the viral load).Protocols will be filled on a daily basis, ranging from day 0 (diagnosis) until day 8.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Similarities in the hijacking mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 andseveral types of cancer, suggest the repurposing of cancer drugs to treatCovid-19. CK2 kinase antagonists have been proposed for cancer treatment. Arecent study in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 found a significant CK2 kinaseactivity, and the use of a CK2 inhibitor showed antiviral responses. CIGB-300,originally designed as an anticancer peptide, is an antagonist of CK2 kinaseactivity that binds to the CK2 phospho-acceptor sites. Recent preliminary resultsshow the antiviral activity of CIGB-300 using a surrogate model of coronavirus.Here we present a computational biology study that provides evidence, at themolecular level, of how CIGB-300 may interfere with the SARS-CoV-2 life cyclewithin infected human cells. METHODS: Sequence analyses and data fromphosphorylation studies were combined to predict infection-induced molecularmechanisms that can be interfered by CIGB-300. Next, we integrated data frommulti-omics studies and data focusing on the antagonistic effect on the CK2kinase activity of CIGB-300. A combination of network and functional enrichmentanalyses was used. RESULTS: Firstly, from the SARS-CoV studies, we inferred thepotential incidence of CIGB-300 in SARS-CoV-2 interference on the immuneresponse. Afterwards, from the analysis of multiple omics data, we proposed theaction of CIGB-300 from the early stages of viral infections perturbing the virushijacking of RNA splicing machinery. We also predicted the interference ofCIGB-300 in virus-host interactions that are responsible for the high infectivityand the particular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, weprovided evidence of how CIGB-300 may participate in the attenuation ofphenotypes related to muscle, bleeding, coagulation and respiratory disorders.CONCLUSIONS: Our computational analysis proposes putative molecular mechanismsthat support the antiviral activity of CIGB-300.

AB  - In view of the potential of traditional plant-based remedies (or phytomedicines) in the management of COVID-19, the present investigation was aimed at findingnovel anti-SARS-CoV-2 molecules by in silico screening of bioactivephytochemicals (database) using computational methods and drug repurposingapproach. A total of 160 compounds belonging to various phytochemical classes(flavonoids, limonoids, saponins, triterpenoids, steroids etc.) were selected (asinitial hits) and screened against three specific therapeutic targets(Mpro/3CLpro, PLpro and RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 by docking, molecular dynamicssimulation and drug-likeness/ADMET studies. From our studies, six phytochemicals were identified as notable ant-SARS-CoV-2 agents (best hit molecules) withpromising inhibitory effects effective against protease (Mpro and PLpro) andpolymerase (RdRp) enzymes. These compounds are namely, ginsenoside Rg2,saikosaponin A, somniferine, betulinic acid, soyasapogenol C and azadirachtin A. On the basis of binding modes and dynamics studies of protein-ligandintercations, ginsenoside Rg2, saikosaponin A, somniferine were found to be themost potent (in silico) inhibitors potentially active against Mpro, PLpro andRdRp, respectively. The present investigation can be directed towards furtherexperimental studies in order to confirm the anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy along with toxicities of identified phytomolecules.

AB  - In the article Analysis of the impact of antidepressants and other medications onCOVID-19 infection risk in a chronic psychiatric in-patient cohort, Catherine L. Clelland and colleagues for the first time suggest a protective effect ofantidepressants against infection with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)itself. During the observation period of the first wave of the pandemic in NewYork, more than 50% of patients in the psychiatric hospital studied wereinfected. From retrospective analysis of the hospital medical records, theauthors found a significantly lower risk for infection in patients withantidepressant medication compared to treatment with other psychiatric drugs. Thefindings of a reduced infection incidence in patients who were already onantidepressant drug therapy underlines a preventive efficacy of antidepressantsagainst COVID-19. Taken together with the prior obtained data of efficacy againstdeterioration of COVID-19 disease, this study adds a piece of evidence to thepositive benefit-risk of antidepressants in repurposing condition againstCOVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: With the recent direction in drug repurposing, many approved drugshave been evaluated to assess their effect on the coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2infection (COVID-19). Driving this path, chloroquine (CQ) has been used in thetreatment of malaria and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in immunomodulatory andanti-thrombotic action, playing a leading role in initial management of the viralinfection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature search was done using GoogleScholar, PubMed and Scopus database using keywords "chloroquine" "SARS-CoV-2""COVID-19" "mechanism of action" and articles of interest were selected providingevidence of the possible role of CQ in viral infection. RESULTS: In a bid tounderstand how and if CQ and HCQ would exert their anti-viral property,mechanistic exegesis was done to review various proposed mechanisms of action.This revealed the inhibition of viral attachment and entry, inhibition ofenveloped glycoprotein, inhibition of the development and proliferation of newviral particles as the way they perform their action. There is an interplaybetween iron metabolism and homeostasis with COVID-19 infection and viralreproduction. CONCLUSIONS: This study aims to show the functional role of CQ and HCQ, as well as to provide possible mechanistic insight on the role of iron onviral infection, iron starvation and its downstream cellular pathways involvinghepcidin and proinflammatory cytokines. The overall aim of providing possiblemode of action of CQ and HCQ in the management of COVID-19 infection is exhibitedvia its anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic activities.

TI  - Reinforcing the supply chain of umifenovir and other antiviral drugs withretrosynthetic software.
PG  - 7327
LID - 10.1038/s41467-021-27547-3 [doi]
AB  - The global disruption caused by the 2020 coronavirus pandemic stressed the supplychain of many products, including pharmaceuticals. Multiple drug repurposingstudies for COVID-19 are now underway. If a winning therapeutic emerges, it isunlikely that the existing inventory of the medicine, or even the chemical rawmaterials needed to synthesize it, will be available in the quantities required. Here, we utilize retrosynthetic software to arrive at alternate chemical supplychains for the antiviral drug umifenovir, as well as eleven other antiviral andanti-inflammatory drugs. We have experimentally validated four routes toumifenovir and one route to bromhexine. In one route to umifenovir the softwareinvokes conversion of six C-H bonds into C-C bonds or functional groups. Thestrategy we apply of excluding known starting materials from search results canbe used to identify distinct starting materials, for instance to relieve stresson existing supply chains.

AB  - To face the COVID-19 pandemic, prophylactic vaccines have been developed inrecord time, but vaccine coverage is still limited, accessibility is notequitable worldwide, and the vaccines are not fully effective against emergingvariants. Therefore, therapeutic treatments are urgently needed to control thepandemic and treat vulnerable populations, but despite all efforts made, options remain scarce. However, the knowledge gained during 2020 constitutes aninvaluable platform from which to build future therapies. In this review, wehighlight the main drug repurposing strategies and achievements made over thefirst 18 months of the pandemic, but also discuss the antivirals,immunomodulators and drug combinations that could be used in the near future tocure COVID-19.

AB  - Drug discovery and repurposing against COVID-19 is a highly relevant topic withhuge efforts dedicated to delivering novel therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2. In this context, computer-aided drug discovery is of interest in orienting the earlyhigh throughput screenings and in optimizing the hit identification rate. Weherein propose a pipeline for Ligand-Based Drug Discovery (LBDD) againstSARS-CoV-2. Through an extensive search of the literature and multiple steps offiltering, we integrated information on 2,610 molecules having a validated effectagainst SARS-CoV and/or SARS-CoV-2. The chemical structures of these moleculeswere encoded through multiple systems to be readily useful as input toconventional machine learning (ML) algorithms or deep learning (DL)architectures. We assessed the performances of seven ML algorithms and four DLalgorithms in achieving molecule classification into two classes: active andinactive. The Random Forests (RF), Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), andDirected Acyclic Graph (DAG) models achieved the best performances. These models were further optimized through hyperparameter tuning and achieved ROC-AUC scores through cross-validation of 85, 83, and 79% for RF, GCN, and DAG models,respectively. An external validation step on the FDA-approved drugs collectionrevealed a superior potential of DL algorithms to achieve drug repurposingagainst SARS-CoV-2 based on the dataset herein presented. Namely, GCN and DAGachieved more than 50% of the true positive rate assessed on the confirmed hitsof a PubChem bioassay.

AB  - A novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 has led to an outbreak of the highly infectiouspandemic COVID-19 complicated viral pneumonia. Patients with risk factorsfrequently develop secondary infections where the role of appropriate antibioticsis mandatory. However, the efforts of drug repurposing lead to recognizing therole of certain antibiotics beyond the management of infection. The currentreview provided the detailed antiviral, immunomodulatory effect, uniquepharmacokinetic profile of two antibiotics namely azithromycin (AZ) anddoxycycline (DOX). It summarizes current clinical trials and concerns regardingsafety issues of these drugs. Azithromycin (AZ) has amazing lung tissue access,wide range antibacterial efficacy, conceivable antiviral action against COVID-19.It also showed efficacy when combined with other antiviral drugs in limitedclinical trials, but many clinicians raise concerns regarding cardiovascular riskin susceptible patients. DOX has a considerable role in the management ofpneumonia, it has some advantages including cardiac safety, very good access tolung tissue, potential antiviral, and immunomodulation impact by severalmechanisms. The pharmacological profiles of both drugs are heighteningconsidering these medications for further studies in the management of COVID-19.

AB  - The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that originated in Chinese city of Wuhan has caused around 906,092 deaths and 28,040,853confirmed cases worldwide (https://covid19.who.int/, 11 September 2020). In alife-threatening situation, where there is no specific and licensed anti-COVID-19vaccine or medicine available; the repurposed drug might act as a silver bullet. Currently, more than 211 vaccines, 80 antibodies, 31 antiviral drugs, 35cell-based, 6 RNA-based and 131 other drugs are in clinical trials. It istherefore utter need of the hour to develop an effective drug that can be usedfor the treatment of COVID-19 before a vaccine can be developed. One of thebest-characterized and attractive drug targets among coronaviruses is the mainprotease (3CL(pro)). Therefore, the current study focuses on the moleculardocking analysis of TAT-peptide(47-57) (GRKKRRQRRRP)-conjugated repurposed drugs (i.e., lopinavir, ritonavir, favipiravir, and hydroxychloroquine) with SARS-CoV-2main protease (3CL(pro)) to discover potential efficacy of TAT-peptide (TP) -conjugated repurposing drugs against SARS-CoV-2. The molecular docking resultsvalidated that TP-conjugated ritonavir, lopinavir, favipiravir, andhydroxychloroquine have superior and significantly enhanced interactions with thetarget SARS-CoV-2 main protease. In-silico approach employed in this studysuggests that the combination of the drug with TP is an excelling alternative to develop a novel drug for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Thedevelopment of TP based delivery of repurposing drugs might be an excellentapproach to enhance the efficacy of the existing drugs for the treatment ofCOVID-19. The predictions from the results obtained provide invaluableinformation that can be utilized for the choice of candidate drugs for in vitro, in vivo and clinical trials. The outcome from this work prove crucial forexploring and developing novel cost-effective and biocompatible TP conjugatedanti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic agents in immediate future.

AB  - Standing amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, we have faced major medical and economiccrisis in recent times which remains to be an unresolved issue till date.Although the scientific community has made significant progress towards diagnosisand understanding the disease; however, effective therapeutics are still lacking.Several omics-based studies, especially proteomics and interactomics, havecontributed significantly in terms of identifying biomarker panels that canpotentially be used for the disease prognosis. This has also paved the way toidentify the targets for drug repurposing as a therapeutic alternative. US Foodand Drug Administration (FDA) has set in motion more than 500 drug developmentprograms on an emergency basis, most of them are focusing on repurposed drugs.Remdesivir is one such success of a robust and quick drug repurposing approach.The advancements in omics-based technologies has allowed to explore altered host proteins, which were earlier restricted to only SARS-CoV-2 protein signatures. Inthis article, we have reviewed major contributions of proteomics andinteractomics techniques towards identifying therapeutic targets for COVID-19.Furthermore, in-silico molecular docking approaches to streamline potential drug candidates are also discussed.

AB  - Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a newcoronavirus discovered that appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, causesCOVID-19 disease which have resulted in cases similar to SARS-atypical pneumonia.Worldwide, around 116 million cases and 2.57 million deaths are reported with newcases and increasing mortality every day. To date, there is no specificcommercial treatment to control the infection. Repurpose drugs targeting theangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor represents an alternativestrategy to block the binding of SARS-CoV-2 protein S and forestall virusadhesion, internalization, and replication in the host cell. Methods: Weperformed a rigid molecular docking using the receptor binding domain of the S1subunit of S protein (RBD S1)-ACE2 (PDB ID: 6VW1) interaction site and 1,283drugs FDA approved. The docking score, frequency of the drug in receptor site,and interactions at the binding site residues were used as analyzing criteria.Results: This research yielded 40 drugs identified as a potential inhibitor ofRBD S1-ACE2 interaction. Among the inhibitors, compounds such as ipratropium,formoterol, and fexofenadine can be found. Specialists employ these drugs astherapies to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and virtuallyany respiratory infection. Conclusions: Our results will serve as the basis forin vitro and in vivo studies to evaluate the potential use of those drugs togenerate affordable and convenient therapies to treat COVID-19.

AB  - PURPOSE: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is one of the mostdevastating global problems. Regarding the lack of disease-specific treatments,repurposing drug therapy is currently considered a promising therapeutic approachin pandemic situations. Recently, the combination therapy of Janus kinase (JAK)inhibitor baricitinib has been authorized for emergency COVID-19 hospitalizedpatients; however, this strategy's safety, drug-drug interactions, and cellularsignaling pathways remain a tremendous challenge. METHODS: In this study, weaimed to provide a deep insight into the baricitinib combination therapies insevere COVID-19 patients through reviewing the published literature on PubMed,Scopus, and Google scholar databases. We also focused on cellular and subcellularpathways related to the synergistic effects of baricitinib plus antiviral agents,virus entry, and cytokine storm (CS) induction. The safety and effectiveness ofthis strategy have also been discussed in moderate to severe forms of COVID-19infection. RESULTS: The severity of COVID-19 is commonly associated with adysregulated immune response and excessive release of pro-inflammatory agents,resulting in CS. It has been shown that baricitinib combined with antiviralagents could modulate the inflammatory response and provide a series of positive therapeutic outcomes in hospitalized adults and pediatric patients (age >/= twoyears old). CONCLUSION: Baricitinib plus the standard of care treatment might be a potential strategy in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19.

AB  - Repurposing regulatory agency approved drugs and investigational compounds withknown safety profiles can significantly fast track the drug development timeline over de novo drug discovery, with lower investment requirements and improvedattrition rate. These advantages are vital in any epidemic or pandemic situation,where hospital beds are occupied by patients for whom there is no knowntreatment. Here we examine drug repurposing in the context of humancoronaviruses, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and, in particular, SARS-CoV-2, the viruscurrently causing a continued widespread pandemic with substantial impacts onpublic health and economy. The key druggable targets explored were those involvedin viral entry, viral replication, and viral-induced ARDS, as well as viralproteases, with a focus on the strategy by which the drugs were repurposed.

TI  - EXOGENOUS Sex Hormones and Sex Hormone Receptor Modulators in COVID-19: Rationaleand Clinical Pharmacology Considerations.
PG  - 559-571
LID - 10.1002/cpt.2508 [doi]
AB  - Male patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) fare much worse thanfemale patients in COVID-19 severity and mortality according to data from severalstudies. Because of this sex disparity, researchers hypothesize that the use ofexogenous sex hormone therapy and sex hormone receptor modulators might providetherapeutic potential for patients with COVID-19. Repurposing approved drugs ordrug candidates at late-stage clinical development could expedite COVID-19therapy development because their clinical formulation, routes of administration,dosing regimen, clinical pharmacology, and potential adverse events have already been established or characterized in humans. A number of exogenous sex hormonesand sex hormone receptor modulators are currently or will be under clinicalinvestigation for COVID-19 therapy. In this review, we discuss the rationale for exogenous sex hormones and sex hormone receptor modulators in COVID-19 treatment,summarize ongoing and planned clinical trials, and discuss some of the clinicalpharmacology considerations on clinical study design. To inform clinical studydesign and facilitate the clinical development of exogenous sex hormones and sex hormone receptor modulators for COVID-19 therapy, clinical investigators shouldpay attention to clinical pharmacology factors, such as dosing regimen, specialpopulations (i.e., geriatrics, pregnancy, lactation, and renal/hepaticimpairment), and drug interactions.

TI  - Emerging Roles of Glycopeptide Antibiotics: Moving beyond Gram-Positive Bacteria.
PG  - 1-28
LID - 10.1021/acsinfecdis.1c00367 [doi]
AB  - Glycopeptides, a class of cell wall biosynthesis inhibitors, have been theantibiotics of choice against drug-resistant Gram-positive bacterial infections. Their unique mechanism of action involving binding to the substrate of cell wall biosynthesis and substantial longevity in clinics makes this class of antibioticsan attractive choice for drug repurposing and reprofiling. However, resistance toglycopeptides has been observed due to alterations in the substrate, cell wallthickening, or both. The emergence of glycopeptide resistance has resulted in thedevelopment of synthetic and semisynthetic glycopeptide analogues to targetacquired resistance. Recent findings demonstrate that these derivatives, alongwith some of the FDA approved glycopeptides have been shown to have antimicrobialactivity against Gram-negative bacteria, Mycobacteria, and viruses thus expandingtheir spectrum of activity across the microbial kingdom. Additional mechanisms ofaction and identification of novel targets have proven to be critical inbroadening the spectrum of activity of glycopeptides. This review focuses on the applications of glycopeptides beyond their traditional target group ofGram-positive bacteria. This will aid in making the scientific community awareabout the nontraditional activity profiles of glycopeptides, identify theexisting loopholes, and further explore this antibiotic class as a potentialbroad-spectrum antimicrobial agent.

TI  - Determining similarities of COVID-19 - lung cancer drugs and affinity bindingmode analysis by graph neural network-based GEFA method.

AB  - COVID-19 is a worldwide health crisis seriously endangering the arsenal ofantiviral and antibiotic drugs. It is urgent to find an effective antiviral drug against pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars-Cov-2),which increases global health concerns. As it can be expensive and time-consumingto develop specific antiviral drugs, reuse of FDA-approved drugs that provide an opportunity to rapidly distribute effective therapeutics can allow to providetreatments with known preclinical, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and toxicity profiles that can quickly enter in clinical trials. In this study, using thestructural information of molecules and proteins, a list of repurposed drugcandidates was prepared again with the graph neural network-based GEFA model. Thedata set from the public databases DrugBank and PubChem were used for analysis.Using the Tanimoto/jaccard similarity analysis, a list of similar drugs wasprepared by comparing the drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 with the drugs used in the treatment of other diseases. The resultant drugs were compared withthe drugs used in lung cancer and repurposed drugs were obtained again bycalculating the binding strength between a drug and a target. The kinaseinhibitors (erlotinib, lapatinib, vandetanib, pazopanib, cediranib, dasatinib,linifanib and tozasertib) obtained from the study can be used as an alternativefor the treatment of COVID-19, as a combination of blocking agents (gefitinib,osimertinib, fedratinib, baricitinib, imatinib, sunitinib and ponatinib) such as ABL2, ABL1, EGFR, AAK1, FLT3 and JAK1, or antiviral therapies (ribavirin,ritonavir-lopinavir and remdesivir).Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

TI  - Opportunities for Drug Repurposing of Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors: PotentialUses in Inflammation, Infection, Cancer, Neuroprotection, and Alzheimer's DiseasePrevention.
PG  - 24-29
LID - 10.1055/a-1686-9620 [doi]
AB  - Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are safe and widely used for a variety ofindications including depressive disorders, anxiety, and chronic pain. Besidesinhibiting the serotonin transporter, these medications have broad-spectrumproperties in many systems. Their roles have been studied in cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and infectious processes. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted theimportance of drug repurposing of medications already in use. We conducted anarrative review of current evidence and ongoing research on drug repurposing of SRIs, with a focus on immunomodulatory, antiproliferative, and neuroprotectiveactivity. SRIs may have clinical use as repurposed agents for a wide variety ofconditions including but not limited to COVID-19, Alzheimer's disease, andneoplastic processes. Further research, particularly randomized controlledtrials, will be necessary to confirm the utility of SRIs for new indications.

AB  - Since the end of 2019, the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory SyndromeCoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved into a global pandemic. There is an urgentneed for effective and low-toxic antiviral drugs to remedy Remdesivir'slimitation. Hydroxychloroquine, a broad spectrum anti-viral drug, showedinhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 in some studies. Thus, we adopted a drugrepurposing strategy, and further investigated hydroxychloroquine. We obtaineddifferent configurations of hydroxychloroquine side chains by using chiralresolution technique, and successfully furnished R-/S-hydroxychloroquine sulfate through chemical synthesis. The R configuration of hydroxychloroquine was foundto exhibit higher antiviral activity (EC50 = 3.05 muM) and lower toxicity invivo. Therefore, R-HCQ is a promising lead compound against SARS-CoV-2. Ourresearch provides new strategy for the subsequent research on small moleculeinhibitors against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), theetiological agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), is a novelBetacoronavirus that was first reported in Wuhan, China in December of 2019. The virus has since caused a worldwide pandemic that highlights the need to quicklyidentify potential prophylactic or therapeutic treatments that can reduce thesigns, symptoms, and/or spread of disease when dealing with a novel infectiousagent. To combat this problem, we constructed a computational pipeline thatuniquely combines existing tools to predict drugs and biologics that could berepurposed to combat an emerging pathogen. Methods: Our workflow analyzesRNA-sequencing data to determine differentially expressed genes, enriched GeneOntology (GO) terms, and dysregulated pathways in infected cells, which can then be used to identify US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs thattarget human proteins within these pathways. We used this pipeline to perform ameta-analysis of RNA-seq data from cells infected with three Betacoronavirusspecies including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV; SARS),Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV; MERS), and SARS-CoV-2, aswell as respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A virus to identifytherapeutics that could be used to treat COVID-19. Results: This analysisidentified twelve existing drugs, most of which already have FDA-approval, thatare predicted to counter the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results were cross-referenced with interventional clinical trials and other studies in theliterature to identify drugs on our list that had previously been identified orused as treatments for COIVD-19 including canakinumab, anakinra, tocilizumab,sarilumab, and baricitinib. Conclusions: While the results reported here arespecific to Betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, our bioinformatics pipelinecan be used to quickly identify candidate therapeutics for future emerginginfectious diseases.

AB  - Development of novel antibodies to combat the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is ongoing. Importantly, particular subgroups are more prone to severe disease, namelypatients with poor immune responses. This includes cancer patients with solid andhaematological disease, solid organ transplant (SOT) patients and those withcongenital or acquired immunodeficiency. Outcomes for patients with poor immuneresponses receiving antibody therapy for underlying disease and SARS-CoV-2 severeinfection are undergoing investigation. The objective of this study was toperform a search on patients with poor immune responses with severe SARS-CoV-2infection, to assess if antibody therapy is beneficial in such populations. Weperformed searches using PubMED and medrXiv up to May 2021 of patients with solidand hematologic malignancy, SOT patients and acquired or congenitalimmunodeficiency. The primary outcome was to assess if antibody therapy wasincluded during SARS-CoV-2 infection and the clinical outcomes of such treatment in this population. Here we find that there is a repurposing of monoclonalantibodies to target cytokine release syndrome, along with the use ofconvalescent plasma (CP). Despite CP demonstrating promising results, wereiterate evidence that CP forces mutational escape and subsequent variantdevelopment. Repurposing of antibody therapies (such as Tocilizumab) provedeffective, especially in SOT patients. This also potentially opens an avenue for the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein neutralizing monoclonal antibodies;however, studies have yet to focus on patients with poor immune responses as asubpopulation.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has undoubtedly become a global crisis. Consequently, discovery and identification of new or known potential drugcandidates to solve the health problems caused by the severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have become an urgent necessity. This currentresearch study sheds light on the possible direct repurposing of theantirheumatic drug teriflunomide to act as an effective and potentanti-SARS-CoV-2 agent. Herein, an interesting computational molecular dockingstudy of teriflunomide, to investigate and evaluate its potential inhibitoryactivities on the novel coronaviral-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nCoV-RdRp)protein, was reported. The docking procedures were accurately carried out onnCoV-RdRp (with/without RNA) using the COVID-19 Docking Server, through adjustingit on the small molecule docking mode. Remdesivir and its active metabolite(GS-441524) were used as the active references for the comparison and evaluation purpose. Interestingly, the computational docking analysis of the best inhibitorybinding mode of teriflunomide in the binding pocket of the active site of theSARS-CoV-2 RdRp revealed that teriflunomide may exhibit significantly strongerinhibitory binding interactions and better inhibitory binding affinities(teriflunomide has considerably lower binding energies of -9.70 and -7.80kcal/mol with RdRp-RNA and RdRp alone, respectively) than both references. It waspreviously reported that teriflunomide strongly inhibits the viral replicationand reproduction through two mechanisms of action, thus the results obtained inthe present study surprisingly support the double mode of antiviral action ofthis antirheumatic ligand. In conclusion, the current research paved the way topractically prove the hypothetical theory of the promising abilities ofteriflunomide to successfully attack the SARS-CoV-2 particles and inhibit theirreplication in a triple mode of action through integrating the newly-discoverednCoV-RdRp-inhibiting properties with the previously-known two anticoronaviralmechanisms of action. Based on the previous interesting facts and results, thetriple SARS-CoV-2/sextet COVID-19 attacker teriflunomide can further undergo invitro/in vivo anti-COVID-19 assays together with preclinical/clinical studies andtrials in an attempt to evaluate and prove its comprehensive pharmacologicalactivities against the different SARS-CoV-2 strains to be effectively used inCOVID-19 therapy in the very near future.

AB  - It has been said that COVID-19 is a generational challenge in many ways. But, at the same time, it becomes a catalyst for collective action, innovation, anddiscovery. Realizing the full potential of artificial intelligence (AI) forstructure determination of unknown proteins and drug discovery are some of these innovations. Potential applications of AI include predicting the structure of theinfectious proteins, identifying drugs that may be effective in targeting theseproteins, and proposing new chemical compounds for further testing as potentialdrugs. AI and machine learning (ML) allow for rapid drug development includingrepurposing existing drugs. Algorithms were used to search for novel or approved antiviral drugs capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. This paper presents a survey ofAI and ML methods being used in various biochemistry of SARS-CoV-2, fromstructure to drug development, in the fight against the deadly COVID-19 pandemic.It is envisioned that this study will provide AI/ML researchers and the widercommunity an overview of the current status of AI applications particularly instructural biology, drug repurposing, and development, and motivate researchersin harnessing AI potentials in the fight against COVID-19.

AB  - The disease which develops following SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, known asCOVID-19, in most affected countries displays mortality from 1.5% to 9.8%. Whenleukocytosis due to granulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and increased level ofD-dimers are detected early during the disease course, they are accuratepredictors of mortality. Based on the published observations that each of theaforementioned disturbances by itself may appear as a consequence of hypoxia, ahypothesis is presented that early hypoxia consequential to sleep apnea and/orblunted respiratory response to chemical stimuli is an early determinant ofCOVID-19 progression to the severe and critical stage. Further, it is noted that host-directed therapies which may counteract hypoxia and its early downstreameffects are initiated only upon hospitalization of COVID-19 patients, which istoo late to be fully effective. An example is anticoagulation treatment with low molecular weight heparin. Repurposing drugs which could counteract some earlyposthypoxic events, such as fluvoxamine, amantadine and N-acetylcysteine, forpost-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and early prehospital treatmentof COVID-19, is indicated.

AB  - There are currently no emergency treatments for pandemics, yet drug repositioninghas emerged as the foremost treatment development strategy for COVID-19, with an aim to identify successful antiviral therapeutics from safe, non-antiviralcandidates. These therapeutics include antibiotics such as azithromycin and theantiparasitic nitazoxanide, both of which exhibit antiviral activity.Broad-spectrum therapeutics (BSTs) are a class of antimicrobials active againstmultiple pathogen types. Establishment of a developmental framework for BSTs willmarkedly improve global preparedness for future health emergencies.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has spread across the globe in no time. In the beginning, peoplesuffered due to the absence of efficacious drugs required to treat severely illpatients. Nevertheless, still, there are no established therapeutic moleculesagainst the SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, repurposing of the drugs started againstSARS-CoV-2, due to which several drugs were approved for the treatment ofCOVID-19 patients. This paper reviewed the treatment regime for COVID-19 through drug repurposing from December 8, 2019 (the day when WHO recognized COVID-19 as apandemic) until today. We have reviewed all the clinical trials from RECOVERYtrials, ACTT-1 and ACTT-2 study group, and other major clinical trial platformspublished in highly reputed journals such as NEJM, Lancet, etc. In addition tosingle-molecule therapy, several combination therapies were also evaluated tounderstand the treatment of COVID-19 from these significant clinical trials. Todate, several lessons have been learned on the therapeutic outcomes for COVID-19.The paper also outlines the experiences gained during the repurposing oftherapeutic molecules (hydroxychloroquine, ritonavir/ lopinavir, favipiravir,remdesivir, ivermectin, dexamethasone, camostatmesylate, and heparin),immunotherapeutic molecules (tocilizumab, mavrilimumab, baricitinib, andinterferons), combination therapy, and convalescent plasma therapy to treatCOVID-19 patients. We summarized that anti-viral therapeutic (remdesivir) andimmunotherapeutic (tocilizumab, dexamethasone, and baricitinib) therapy showedsome beneficial outcomes. Until March 2021, 4952 clinical trials have beenregistered in ClinicalTrials.gov toward the drug and vaccine development forCOVID-19. More than 100 countries have participated in contributing to theseclinical trials. Other than the registered clinical trials (medium tolarge-size), several small-size clinical trials have also been conducted fromtime to time to evaluate the treatment of COVID-19. Four molecules showedbeneficial therapeutic to treat COVID-19 patients. The short-term repurposing of the existing drug may provide a successful outcome for COVID-19 patients.Therefore, more clinical trials can be initiated using potential anti-viralmolecules by evaluating in different phases of clinical trials.

TI  - Association of lipid-lowering drugs with COVID-19 outcomes from a Mendelianrandomization study.

AB  - Background: Lipid metabolism plays an important role in viral infections. Weaimed to assess the causal effect of lipid-lowering drugs (HMGCR inhibitiors,PCSK9 inhibitiors, and NPC1L1 inhibitior) on COVID-19 outcomes using two-sampleMendelian randomization (MR) study. Methods: We used two kinds of geneticinstruments to proxy the exposure of lipid-lowering drugs, including expressionquantitative trait loci of drugs target genes, and genetic variants within ornearby drugs target genes associated with low-density lipoprotein (LDLcholesterol from genome-wide association study). Summary-data-based MR (SMR) and inverse-variance-weighted MR (IVW-MR) were used to calculate the effectestimates. Results: SMR analysis found that a higher expression of HMGCR wasassociated with a higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] =1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-1.81). Similarly, IVW-MR analysisobserved a positive association between HMGCR-mediated LDL cholesterol andCOVID-19 hospitalization (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.00-1.74). No consistent evidence from both analyses was found for other associations. Conclusions: This two-sampleMR study suggested a potential causal relationship between HMGCR inhibition andthe reduced risk of COVID-19 hospitalization.

OAB - The virus SARS-CoV-2 has caused millions of infections and deaths during theCOVID-19 pandemic, but as of December 2021, no new drugs targeted to SARS-CoV-2specifically exist. Thus, it is important to identify existing drugs that canreduce the infection and mortality of this virus, since repurposing old drugs is faster and cheaper than developing new ones. Fats, such as cholesterol, can play an important role in viral infections, meaning that drugs intended to lower thelevels of fats in the blood could have a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2. Totest this hypothesis, Huang, Xiao, et al. carried out a Mendelian randomizationstudy to investigate if there is a link between drugs that lower fats andoutcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including susceptibility, hospitalization, and severe disease. This approach consists on grouping people according to theirversion of a particular gene, which minimizes the effect of variables that cancause spurious associations, something known as confounding bias. Thus, Mendelianrandomization studies allow scientists to disentangle cause and effect. Usingthis method, Huang, Xiao, et al. found an association between statins (a type of drug that decreases the levels of bad cholesterol) and a reduced risk of beinghospitalized after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. These findings suggest thatstatins could benefit patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and indicate that theyshould be prioritized in future clinical trials for treating COVID-19.

AB  - Diagnostics, vaccines, and drugs are indispensable tools and control measuresemployed to overcome infectious diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19). Diagnostic tools based on RT-PCR were developed early in the COVID-19pandemic and were urgently required for quarantine (testing, tracing andisolation). Vaccines such as mRNA vaccines and virus-vectored vaccines were also successfully developed using new platform technologies within one year afteridentifying severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as thecausative agent of COVID-19. Drug development has been conducted in various ways including drug repurposing, convalescent plasma therapy, and monoclonal antibody development. Among the above efforts, this review examines COVID-19 drugdevelopment along with the related and upcoming challenges.

AB  - To better understand the potential of drug repurposing in COVID-19, we analyzedcontrol strategies over essential host factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Weconstructed comprehensive directed protein-protein interaction (PPI) networksintegrating the top-ranked host factors, the drug target proteins and directedPPI data. We analyzed the networks to identify drug targets and combinationsthereof that offer efficient control over the host factors. We validated ourfindings against clinical studies data and bioinformatics studies. Our methodoffers a new insight into the molecular details of the disease and intopotentially new therapy targets for it. Our approach for drug repurposing issignificant beyond COVID-19 and may be applied also to other diseases.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for the identification ofnew antiviral drug therapies for a variety of diseases. COVID-19 is caused byinfection with the human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, while other related humancoronaviruses cause diseases ranging from severe respiratory infections to thecommon cold. We developed a computational approach to identify new antiviral drugtargets and repurpose clinically-relevant drug compounds for the treatment of arange of human coronavirus diseases. Our approach is based on graph convolutionalnetworks (GCN) and involves multiscale host-virus interactome analysis coupled tooff-target drug predictions. Cell-based experimental assessment reveals severalclinically-relevant drug repurposing candidates predicted by the in silicoanalyses to have antiviral activity against human coronavirus infection. Inparticular, we identify the MET inhibitor capmatinib as having potent and broadantiviral activity against several coronaviruses in a MET-independent manner, as well as novel roles for host cell proteins such as IRAK1/4 in supporting humancoronavirus infection, which can inform further drug discovery studies.

AB  - Since early 2020, scientists have strived to find an effective solution to fight SARS-CoV-2, in particular by developing reliable vaccines that inhibit the spreadof the disease and repurposing drugs for combatting its effects on the humanbody. The antiviral prodrug Remdesivir is still the most widely used therapeutic during the early stages of the infection. However, the current synthetic routesrely on the use of protecting groups, air-sensitive reagents, and cryogenicconditions, thus impeding a cost-efficient supply to patients. We have,therefore, focused on the development of a straightforward, direct addition of(hetero)arenes to unprotected sugars. Here we report a silylium-catalyzed andcompletely stereoselective C-glycosylation that initially yields the open-chainpolyols, which can be selectively cyclized to provide either the kineticalpha-furanose or the thermodynamically favored beta-anomer. The methodsignificantly expedites the synthesis of Remdesivir precursor GS-441524 after asubsequent Mn-catalyzed C-H oxidation and deoxycyanation.

AB  - COVID-19 is a clinical outcome of viral infection emerged due to strain of betacoronavirus which attacks the type-2 pneumocytes in alveoli viaangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. There is no satisfactory drugdeveloped against 'SARS-CoV2', highlighting an immediate necessitychemotherapeutic repurposing plan COVID-19. Drug repurposing is a method ofselection of approved therapeutics for new use and is considered to be the mosteffective drug finding strategy since it includes less time and cost to obtaintreatment compared to the de novo drug acquisition process. Several drugs such ashydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, teicoplanin, darunavir, ritonavir, nitazoxanide, chloroquine, tocilizumab and favipiravir (FPV) showed their activity against'SARS-CoV2' in vitro. This review has emphasized on repurposing of drugs, andbiologics used in clinical set up for targeting COVID-19 and to evaluate theirpharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety with their future aspect. The keybenefit of drug repurposing is the wealth of information related to its safety,and easy accessibility. Altogether repurposing approach allows access toregulatory approval as well as reducing sophisticated safety studies.

TI  - Amantadine has potential for the treatment of COVID-19 because it inhibits known and novel ion channels encoded by SARS-CoV-2.
PG  - 1347
LID - 10.1038/s42003-021-02866-9 [doi]
AB  - The dire need for COVID-19 treatments has inspired strategies of repurposingapproved drugs. Amantadine has been suggested as a candidate, and cellular aswell as clinical studies have indicated beneficial effects of this drug. Wedemonstrate that amantadine and hexamethylene-amiloride (HMA), but notrimantadine, block the ion channel activity of Protein E from SARS-CoV-2, aconserved viroporin among coronaviruses. These findings agree with their binding to Protein E as evaluated by solution NMR and molecular dynamics simulations.Moreover, we identify two novel viroporins of SARS-CoV-2; ORF7b and ORF10, byshowing ion channel activity in a X. laevis oocyte expression system. Notably,amantadine also blocks the ion channel activity of ORF10, thereby providing twoion channel targets in SARS-CoV-2 for amantadine treatment in COVID-19 patients. A screen of known viroporin inhibitors on Protein E, ORF7b, ORF10 and Protein 3a from SARS-CoV-2 revealed inhibition of Protein E and ORF7b by emodin andxanthene, the latter also blocking Protein 3a. This illustrates a generalpotential of well-known ion channel blockers against SARS-CoV-2 and specifically a dual molecular basis for the promising effects of amantadine in COVID-19treatment. We therefore propose amantadine as a novel, cheap, readily availableand effective way to treat COVID-19.

PG  - 285-294

AB  - Cepharanthine (CEP) is a natural biscoclaurine alkaloid of plant origin and wasrecently demonstrated to have anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) activity. In this study, we evaluated whether naturalanalogues of CEP may act as potential anti-coronavirus disease 2019 drugs. Atotal of 24 compounds resembling CEP were extracted from the KNApSAcK database,and their binding affinities to target proteins, including the spike protein and main protease of SARS-CoV-2, NPC1 and TPC2 in humans, were predicted viamolecular docking simulations. Selected analogues were further evaluated by acell-based SARS-CoV-2 infection assay. In addition, the efficacies of CEP and itsanalogue tetrandrine were assessed. A comparison of the docking conformations of these compounds suggested that the diphenyl ester moiety of the molecules was aputative pharmacophore of the CEP analogues.

AB  - Since the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in 2019 and thepandemic continues for more than one year, a vast amount of drug research hasbeen conducted and few of them got FDA approval. Our objective is to prioritizerepurposable drugs using a pipeline that systematically integrates theinteraction between COVID-19 and drugs, deep graph neural networks, and invitro/population-based validations. We first collected all available drugs (n =3635) related to COVID-19 patient treatment through CTDbase. We built a COVID-19 knowledge graph based on the interactions among virus baits, host genes,pathways, drugs, and phenotypes. A deep graph neural network approach was used toderive the candidate drug's representation based on the biological interactions. We prioritized the candidate drugs using clinical trial history, and thenvalidated them with their genetic profiles, in vitro experimental efficacy, andpopulation-based treatment effect. We highlight the top 22 drugs includingAzithromycin, Atorvastatin, Aspirin, Acetaminophen, and Albuterol. We furtherpinpointed drug combinations that may synergistically target COVID-19. Insummary, we demonstrated that the integration of extensive interactions, deepneural networks, and multiple evidence can facilitate the rapid identification ofcandidate drugs for COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neuropeptide that is produced by thelymphoid cells and plays a major role in immunological functions for controlling the homeostasis of the immune system. VIP has been identified as a potentanti-inflammatory factor, in boosting both innate and adaptive immunity. SinceDecember 2019, SARS-Cov-2 was found responsible for the disease COVID-19 whichhas spread worldwide. No specific therapies or 100% effective vaccines are yetavailable for the treatment of COVID-19. Drug repositioning may offer a strategy and several drugs have been repurposed, including lopinavir/ritonavir,remdesivir, favipiravir, and tocilizumab. This paper describes the mainpharmacological properties of synthetic VIP drug (Aviptadil) which is now underclinical trials. A patented formulation of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide(VIP), named RLF-100 (Aviptadil), was developed and finally got approved forhuman trials by FDA in 2001 and in European medicines agency in 2005. It wasawarded Orphan Drug Designation in 2001 by the US FDA for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome and for the treatment of pulmonary arterialhypertension in 2005. Investigational new drug (IND) licenses for human trials ofAviptadil was guaranteed by both the US FDA and EMEA. Preliminary clinical trialsseem to support Aviptadil's benefit. However, such drugs like Aviptadil inCOVID-19 patients have peculiar safety profiles. Thus, adequate clinical trialsare necessary for these compounds.

AB  - Emergence of new viral agents is driven by evolution of interactions betweenviral proteins and host targets. For instance, increased infectivity ofSARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 arose in part through rapid evolution along theinterface between the spike protein and its human receptor ACE2, leading toincreased binding affinity. To facilitate broader exploration of howpathogen-host interactions might impact transmission and virulence in the ongoingCOVID-19 pandemic, we performed state-of-the-art interface prediction followed bymolecular docking to construct a three-dimensional structural interactome betweenSARS-CoV-2 and human. We additionally carried out downstream meta-analyses toinvestigate enrichment of sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2or human population variants along viral-human protein-interaction interfaces,predict changes in binding affinity by these mutations/variants and furtherprioritize drug repurposing candidates predicted to competitively bind humantargets. We believe this resource ( http://3D-SARS2.yulab.org ) will aid indevelopment and testing of informed hypotheses for SARS-CoV-2 etiology andtreatments.

AB  - COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and responsible for the ongoing global pandemic in the world. After more than a year, we are still in lurch to combat and controlthe situation. Therefore, new therapeutic options to control the ongoing COVID-19are urgently in need. In our study, we found that nonstructural protein 4 (Nsp4) of SARS-CoV-2 could be a potential target for drug repurposing. Due toavailability of only the crystal structure of C-terminal domain of Nsp4 (Ct-Nsp4)and its crucial participation in viral RNA synthesis, we have chosen Ct-Nsp4 as atarget for screening the 1600 FDA-approved drugs using molecular docking. Top 102drugs were found to have the binding energy equal or less than -7.0 kcal/mol.Eribulin and Suvorexant were identified as the two most promising drug molecules based on the docking score. The dynamics of Ct-Nsp4-drug binding was monitoredusing 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations. From binding free energy calculationover the simulation, both the drugs were found to have considerable bindingenergy. The present study has identified Eribulin and Suvorexant as promisingdrug candidates. This finding will be helpful to accelerate the drug discoveryprocess against COVID-19 disease.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - Drug repositioning has been used extensively since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in an attempt to identify antiviral molecules for use in humantherapeutics. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have shown inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication in different cell lines. Based on such in vitrodata and despite the weakness of preclinical assessment, many clinical trialswere set up using these molecules. In the present study, we show thathydroxychloroquine and azithromycin alone or combined does not block SARS-CoV-2replication in human bronchial airway epithelia. When tested in a Syrian hamster model, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin administrated alone or combineddisplayed no significant effect on viral replication, clinical course of thedisease and lung impairments, even at high doses. Hydroxychloroquinequantification in lung tissues confirmed strong exposure to the drug, above invitro inhibitory concentrations. Overall, this study does not support the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as antiviral drugs for the treatment ofSARS-CoV-2 infections.

PG  - 304
LID - 10.1186/s12931-021-01885-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world extraordinarily. Thisdisease has a potential to cause a significantly severe course of disease leadingto respiratory complications, multiple organ failure and possibly death. In thefight against this pandemic-causing disease, medical professionals around theworld are searching for pharmacological agents that could treat and preventdisease progression and mortality. To speed the search of promising treatmentoptions, already existing pharmacological agents are repurposed for the potentialtreatment of COVID-19 and tested in clinical trials. The aim of this literaturereview is to investigate the efficacy and safety of repurposed pharmacologicalagents for the treatment of COVID-19 at different pathophysiologic stages of the disease. For this literature review, online-databases PubMed and Google Scholarwere utilised. Keywords "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2", "pathogenesis", "drug targets","pharmacological treatment", "cytokine storm", "coagulopathy" and individual drugnames were used. Scientific articles, including reviews, clinical trials, andobservational cohorts, were collected and analysed. Furthermore, these articleswere examined for references to find more clinical trials testing for thepotential treatment of COVID-19. In total, 97 references were used to conductthis research paper. RESULTS: The most beneficial pharmacological agent for thetreatment of COVID-19 are corticosteroids, especially dexamethasone, for thetreatment of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. Other promising agentsare remdesivir for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiringminimal supplemental oxygen therapy, and IL-6 receptor antagonist monoclonalantibodies in severe COVID-19. Lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as chloroquine orhydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin demonstrate the least efficacy inthe treatment of COVID-19. The clinical benefits of the treatment of aCOVID-19-specific coagulopathy with increased dosing of anticoagulation needfurther research and confirmation of randomised controlled trials. CONCLUSION:The search for pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 has elicited greatcontroversy. Whereas drugs like chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, andlopinavir/ritonavir have not shown proven benefit, the agents remdesivir anddexamethasone are recommended for clinical use for the treatment of COVID-19.Further randomised trials for other pharmacological treatment strategies areawaited.

LID - 10.3390/vaccines9111317 [doi]
AB  - Respiratory viruses represent a major public health concern, as they are highlymutated, resulting in new strains emerging with high pathogenicity. Currently,the world is suffering from the newly evolving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), a mild-to-severe respiratory tract infection with frequent ability togive rise to fatal pneumonia in humans. The overwhelming outbreak of SARS-CoV-2continues to unfold all over the world, urging scientists to put an end to thisglobal pandemic through biological and pharmaceutical interventions. Currently,there is no specific treatment option that is capable of COVID-19 pandemiceradication, so several repurposed drugs and newly conditionally approvedvaccines are in use and heavily applied to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Theemergence of new variants of the virus that partially or totally escape from the immune response elicited by the approved vaccines requires continuous monitoring of the emerging variants to update the content of the developed vaccines ormodify them totally to match the new variants. Herein, we discuss the potentialtherapeutic and prophylactic interventions including repurposed drugs and thenewly developed/approved vaccines, highlighting the impact of virus evolution on the immune evasion of the virus from currently licensed vaccines for COVID-19.

AB  - Anti-viral small molecules are currently lacking for treating coronavirusinfection. The long development timescales for such drugs are a major problem,but could be shortened by repurposing existing drugs. We therefore screened asmall library of FDA-approved compounds for potential severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antivirals using a pseudovirus system thatallows a sensitive read-out of infectivity. A group of structurally-relatedcompounds, showing moderate inhibitory activity with IC50 values in the 2-5 muMrange, were identified. Further studies demonstrated that these "kite-shaped"molecules were surprisingly specific for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and that they acted early in the entry steps of the viral infectious cycle, but did not affect virus attachment to the cells. Moreover, the compounds were able to preventinfection in both kidney- and lung-derived human cell lines. The structuralhomology of the hits allowed the production of a well-defined pharmacophore that was found to be highly accurate in predicting the anti-viral activity of thecompounds in the screen. We discuss the prospects of repurposing these existingdrugs for treating current and future coronavirus outbreaks.

AB  - Since its licensing in 1971, the synthetic compound inosine pranobex has beeneffectively combating viral infections, including herpes zoster, varicella,measles, and infections caused by the herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus,Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and respiratory viruses. With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, new and existing drugs have been intensively evaluated for theirpotential as COVID-19 medication. Due to its potent immunomodulatory properties, inosine pranobex, an orally administered drug with pleiotropic effects, can,during early treatment, alter the course of the disease. We describe the actionof inosine pranobex in the body and give an overview of existing evidencecollected to support further efforts to study this drug in a rigorous clinicaltrial setup.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the reason for worldwide pandemic, has already masked around 220 countries globally. This disease is induced by SevereAcute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Arising environmentalstress, increase in the oxidative stress level, weak immunity and lack ofnutrition deteriorates the clinical status of the infected patients. Thoughseveral researches are at its peak for understanding and bringing forwardeffective therapeutics, yet there is no promising solution treating this disease directly. Medicinal plants and their active metabolites have always beenpromising in treating many clinical complications since time immemorial. Mothernature provides vivid chemical structures, which act multi-dimensionally allalone or synergistically in mitigating several diseases. Their unique antioxidantand anti-inflammatory activity with least side effects have made them moreeffective candidate for pharmacological studies. These medicinal plants inhibitattachment, encapsulation and replication of COVID-19 viruses by targetingvarious signaling molecules such as angiotensin converting enzyme-2,transmembrane serine protease 2, spike glycoprotein, main protease etc. Thisproperty is re-examined and its potency is now used to improve the existingglobal health crisis. This review is an attempt to focus various antiviralactivities of various noteworthy medicinal plants. Moreover, its implications as prophylactic or preventive in various secondary complications includingneurological, cardiovascular, acute kidney disease, liver disease are alsopinpointed in the present review. This knowledge will help emphasis on thetherapeutic developments for this novel coronavirus where it can be used as aloneor in combination with the repositioned drugs to combat COVID-19.

LID - 1505 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines9111505 [doi]
AB  - In an emergency, drug repurposing is the best alternative option against newlyemerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.However, several bioactive natural products have shown potential againstSARS-CoV-2 in recent studies. The present study selected sixty-eightbroad-spectrum antiviral marine terpenoids and performed molecular dockingagainst two novel SARS-CoV-2 enzymes (main protease or M(pro) or 3CL(pro)) andRNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In addition, the present study analysed the physiochemical-toxicity-pharmacokinetic profile, structural activityrelationship, and phylogenetic tree with various computational tools to selectthe 'lead' candidate. The genomic diversity study with multiple sequence analysesand phylogenetic tree confirmed that the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 strain was upto 96% structurally similar to existing CoV-strains. Furthermore, theanti-SARS-CoV-2 potency based on a protein-ligand docking score (kcal/mol)exposed that the marine terpenoid brevione F (-8.4) and stachyflin (-8.4)exhibited similar activity with the reference antiviral drugs lopinavir (-8.4)and darunavir (-7.5) against the target SARS-CoV-M(pro). Similarly, marineterpenoids such as xiamycin (-9.3), thyrsiferol (-9.2), liouvilloside B (-8.9),liouvilloside A (-8.8), and stachyflin (-8.7) exhibited comparatively higherdocking scores than the referral drug remdesivir (-7.4), and favipiravir (-5.7)against the target SARS-CoV-2-RdRp. The above in silico investigations concluded that stachyflin is the most 'lead' candidate with the most potential againstSARS-CoV-2. Previously, stachyflin also exhibited potential activity againstHSV-1 and CoV-A59 within IC50, 0.16-0.82 microM. Therefore, some additionalpharmacological studies are needed to develop 'stachyflin' as a drug againstSARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of COVID-19 have not beenfully discovered. This study aims to decipher potentially hidden parts of thepathogenesis of COVID-19, potential novel drug targets, and identify potentialdrug candidates. Two gene expression profiles were analyzed, and overlappingdifferentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected for which top enrichedtranscription factors and kinases were identified, and pathway analysis wasperformed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) of DEGs was constructed, hub geneswere identified, and module analysis was also performed. DGIdb database was used to identify drugs for the potential targets (hub genes and the most enrichedtranscription factors and kinases for DEGs). A drug-potential target network was constructed, and drugs were ranked according to the degree. L1000FDW was used to identify drugs that can reverse transcriptional profiles of COVID-19. Weidentified drugs currently in clinical trials, others predicted by differentmethods, and novel potential drug candidates Entrectinib, Omeprazole, andExemestane for combating COVID-19. Besides the well-known pathogenic pathways, itwas found that axon guidance is a potential pathogenic pathway. Sema7A, which mayexacerbate hypercytokinemia, is considered a potential novel drug target. Anotherpotential novel pathway is related to TINF2 overexpression, which may inducepotential telomere dysfunction and damage DNA that may exacerbate lung fibrosis. This study identified new potential insights regarding COVID-19 pathogenesis and treatment, which might help us improve our understanding of the mechanisms ofCOVID-19.

AB  - Screening already approved drugs for activity against a novel pathogen can be an important part of global rapid-response strategies in pandemics. Suchhigh-throughput repurposing screens have already identified several existingdrugs with potential to combat SARS-CoV-2. However, moving these hits forward forpossible development into drugs specifically against this pathogen requiresunambiguous identification of their corresponding targets, something thehigh-throughput screens are not typically designed to reveal. We present here anew computational inverse-docking protocol that uses all-atom protein structures and a combination of docking methods to rank-order targets for each of severalexisting drugs for which a plurality of recent high-throughput screens detectedanti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. We demonstrate validation of this method with knowndrug-target pairs, including both non-antiviral and antiviral compounds. Wesubjected 152 distinct drugs potentially suitable for repurposing to the inverse docking procedure. The most common preferential targets were the human enzymesTMPRSS2 and PIKfyve, followed by the viral enzymes Helicase and PLpro. Allcompounds that selected TMPRSS2 are known serine protease inhibitors, and thosethat selected PIKfyve are known tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Detailed structuralanalysis of the docking poses revealed important insights into why theseselections arose, and could potentially lead to more rational design of new drugsagainst these targets.

AB  - The ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a seriousthreat to global public health. Drug repurposing is a time-efficient approach to finding effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 in this emergency. Here, we present a robust experimental design combining deep learning with molecular dockingexperiments to identify the most promising candidates from the list ofFDA-approved drugs that can be repurposed to treat COVID-19. We have employed adeep learning-based Drug Target Interaction (DTI) model, called DeepDTA, with fewimprovements to predict drug-protein binding affinities, represented as KIBAscores, for 2440 FDA-approved and 8168 investigational drugs against 24SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. FDA-approved drugs with the highest KIBA scores wereselected for molecular docking simulations. We ran around 50,000 dockingsimulations for 168 selected drugs against 285 total predicted and/orexperimentally proven active sites of all 24 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. A list of49 most promising FDA-approved drugs with the best consensus KIBA scores andbinding affinity values against selected SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins was generated.Most importantly, 16 drugs including anidulafungin, velpatasvir, glecaprevir,rifapentine, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), terlipressin, and selinexordemonstrated the highest predicted inhibitory potential against key SARS-CoV-2viral proteins. We further measured the inhibitory activity of 5 compounds(rifapentine, velpatasvir, glecaprevir, anidulafungin, and FAD disodium) onSARS-CoV-2 PLpro using Ubiquitin-Rhodamine 110 Gly fluorescent intensity assay.The highest inhibition of PLpro activity was seen with rifapentine (IC50: 15.18muM) and FAD disodium (IC50: 12.39 muM), the drugs with high predicted KIBAscores and binding affinities.

AB  - The coronavirus helicase is an essential enzyme required for viralreplication/transcription pathways. Structural studies revealed a sulphate moietythat interacts with key residues within the nucleotide-binding site of thehelicase. Compounds with a sulphoxide or a sulphone moiety could interfere withthese interactions and consequently inhibit the enzyme. The molecular operatingenvironment (MOE) was used to dock 189 sulphoxide and sulphone-containingFDA-approved compounds to the nucleotide-binding site. Zafirlukast, a leukotrienereceptor antagonist used to treat chronic asthma, achieved the lowest dockingscore at -8.75 kcals/mol. The inhibitory effect of the compounds on theSARS-CoV-2 helicase dsDNA unwinding activity was tested by a FRET-based assay.Zafirlukast was the only compound to inhibit the enzyme (IC50 = 16.3 microM). Thetreatment of Vero E6 cells with 25 microM zafirlukast prior to SARS-CoV-2infection decreased the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 significantly. Theseresults suggest that zafirlukast alleviates SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity byinhibiting the viral helicase and impairing the viral replication/transcriptionpathway. Zafirlukast could be clinically developed as a new antiviral treatmentfor SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus diseases. This discovery is based onmolecular modelling, in vitro inhibition of the SARS-CoV helicase activity andcell-based SARS-CoV-2 viral replication.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious and deadly coronavirus whosestudy requires the use of a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) containment facility toinvestigate viral biology and pathogenesis, which limits the study of live virus and slows progress toward finding suitable treatments for infection. Whilevaccines from several companies have proven very effective in combating thevirus, few treatments exist for those who do succumb to the viral-inducedsystemic disease called COVID-19. AREAS COVERED: This short review focuses onfluorescent quantum dot-based modeling of SARS-CoV-2. New BSL-2 viral models are essential for finding small molecules and biologics that may be effective instopping viral infection, as well as treating already infected individuals.Nanoparticles are invaluable tools for biological research as they can be used toboth model pathogens and serve as a platform for developing vaccines. EXPERTOPINION: Visualizing viral activity with fluorescent quantum dots enables bothbiochemical and cell-based assays to detect virus-host receptor interactions,cellular activity after binding to the cell plasma membrane, screening forinterventions using small-molecule drug repurposing, and testing of novelbiologics. Quantum dots can also be used for diagnostic assays, vaccinedevelopment, and importantly, pan-antiviral drugs to address variants that mayescape the immune response.

TI  - Re-purposing of hepatitis C virus FDA approved direct acting antivirals aspotential SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors.

AB  - A new coronavirus strain called as SARS-CoV-2 has emerged from Wuhan, China inlate 2019 and it caused a worldwide pandemic in a few months. After the SecondWorld War, it is the biggest calamity observed as there is no specific US Foodand Drugs Administration (USFDA) approved drug or vaccine available globally for the treatment. Several clinical trials are ongoing for therapeutic alternatives, however with little success rate. Considering that the time is crucial, the drug repurposing and data obtained from in silico models are one of the most importantapproaches to identify possible lead inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2. Morerecently, the Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) are emerged as the most promisingdrugs to control viral infection. The Main Protease (Mpro), a key enzyme in theSARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, is found close homolog to the Hepatitis C Virus(HCV) protease and could be susceptible of blocking its activity by DAAs. In the current study, the DAAs were investigated as antivirals using structure basedcomputational approach against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 to propose them as newtherapeutics. In total, 20 DAAs of HCV, including a reference compound O6K weredocked against Mpro. The docked structures were examined and resulted in theidentification of six highly promising DAAs i.e. beclabuvir, elbasvir,paritaprevir, grazoprevir, simeprevir, and asunapevir exhibiting high theoreticalbinding affinity to Mpro from SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to other DAAs.Furthermore, the post docking analysis revealed that Cys145, Glu166, His163,Thr26, His41, and Met165 played potential role for the binding of these DAAsinside binding site of Mpro. Furthermore, the correlation between bindingenergies were found in accord with the results from the reported IC50s for someDAAs. Overall, the current study provides insight to combat COVID-19 usingFDA-approved DAAs as repurposed drugs.

AB  - To fight COVID-19, much effort has been directed toward in vitro drugrepurposing. Here, we investigate the impact of colloidal aggregation, a commonscreening artifact, in these repurposing campaigns. We tested 56 drugs reportedas active in biochemical assays for aggregation by dynamic light scattering andby detergent-based enzyme counter screening; 19 formed colloids at concentrationssimilar to their literature IC50's, and another 14 were problematic. From acommon repurposing library, we further selected another 15 drugs that hadphysical properties resembling known aggregators, finding that six aggregated at micromolar concentrations. This study suggests not only that many of the drugsrepurposed for SARS-CoV-2 in biochemical assays are artifacts but that, moregenerally, at screening-relevant concentrations, even drugs can act artifactuallyvia colloidal aggregation. Rapid detection of these artifacts will allow thecommunity to focus on those molecules that genuinely have potential for treating COVID-19.

AB  - Current pandemics propelled research efforts in unprecedented fashion, primarily triggering computational efforts towards new vaccine and drug development as wellas drug repurposing. There is an urgent need to design novel drugs with targeted biological activity and minimum adverse reactions that may be useful to manageviral outbreaks. Hence an attempt has been made to develop Machine Learning basedpredictive models that can be used to assess whether a compound has the potencyto be antiviral or not. To this end, a set of 2358 antiviral compounds werecompiled from the CAS COVID-19 antiviral SAR dataset whose activity was reported based on IC50 value. A total 1157 two-dimensional molecular descriptors werecomputed among which, the most highly correlated descriptors were selected using Tree-based, Correlation-based and Mutual information-based feature selectionmethods. Seven Machine Learning algorithms i. e., Random Forest, XGBoost, SupportVector Machine, KNN, Decision Tree, MLP Classifier and Logistic Regression werebenchmarked. The best performance was achieved by the models developed usingRandom Forest and XGBoost algorithms in all the feature selection methods. Themaximum predictive accuracy of both these models was 88 % with internalvalidation. Whereas, with an external dataset, a maximum accuracy of 93.10 % for XGBoost and 100 % for Random Forest based model was achievable. Furthermore, the study demonstrated scaffold analysis of the molecules as a pragmatic approach to explore the importance of structurally diverse compounds in data driven studies.

AB  - Leveraging limited clinical and nonclinical data through modeling approachesfacilitates new drug development and regulatory decision making amid thecoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Model-informed drug development(MIDD) is an essential tool to integrate those data and generate evidence to (i) provide support for effectiveness in repurposed or new compounds to combatCOVID-19 and dose selection when clinical data are lacking; (ii) assess efficacy under practical situations such as dose reduction to overcome supply issues oremergence of resistant variant strains; (iii) demonstrate applicability of MIDDfor full extrapolation to adolescents and sometimes to young pediatric patients; and (iv) evaluate the appropriateness for prolonging a dosing interval to reduce the frequency of hospital visits during the pandemic. Ongoing research activitiesof MIDD reflect our continuous effort and commitment in bridging knowledge gapsthat leads to the availability of effective treatments through innovation. Caseexamples are presented to illustrate how MIDD has been used in various stages of drug development and has the potential to inform regulatory decision making.

AB  - Antimicrobials are essential for combating infectious diseases. However, anincrease in resistance to them is a major cause of concern. The empirical use of drugs in managing COVID-19 and the associated secondary infections have furtherexacerbated the problem of antimicrobial resistance. Hence, the situationmandates exploring and developing efficient alternatives for the treatment ofbacterial and fungal infections in patients suffering from COVID-19 or otherviral infections. In this review, we have described the alternatives toconventional antimicrobials that have shown promising results and are at various stages of development. An acceleration of efforts to investigate their potential as therapeutics can provide more treatment options for clinical management ofdrug-resistant secondary bacterial and fungal infections in the current pandemic and similar potential outbreaks in the future. The alternatives includebacteriophages and their lytic enzymes, anti-fungal enzymes, antimicrobialpeptides, nanoparticles and small molecule inhibitors among others. What isrequired at this stage is to critically examine the challenges in developing the listed compounds and biomolecules as therapeutics and to establish guidelines fortheir safe and effective application within a suitable time frame. In thisreview, we have attempted to highlight the importance of rational use ofantimicrobials in patients suffering from COVID-19 and boost the deployment ofalternative therapeutics.

AB  - COVID-19 has shaken all the countries across the globe and researchers are tryingto find promising antiviral to cure the patients suffering from infection and candecrease the death. Even, different nations are using repurposing drugs to curethe symptoms and these repurposing drugs are hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and lopinavir, and recently, India has recently given the approval for the2-deoxy-D-glucose for emergency purpose to cure the patients suffering from theCOVID-19. Plitidepsin is a popular molecule and can be used in treatment ofmyeloma. Plitidepsin was explored by scientists experimentally against theCOVID-19 and was given to the patient. It is found to be more a promisingrepurposing drug against the COVID-19 than the remdesivir. Therefore, there is a need to understand the interaction of plitidepsin with the main protease ofSARS-CoV-2. Molecular docking of the plitidepsin against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 wasperformed and the binding energy was found to be - 137.992 kcal/mol. Furthermore,authors have performed the molecular dynamics simulations of the main protease ofSARS-CoV-2 in presence of plitidepsin at 300 and 325 K. It was found that theplitidepsin binds effectively with the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 at 300 K.

AB  - Search for new antiviral medications has surged in the past two years due to the COVID-19 crisis. Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is among one of the most importantTLR proteins of innate immunity that is responsible for broad antiviral response and immune system control. TLR7 agonists, as both vaccine adjuvants and immuneresponse modulators, are among the top drug candidates for not only ourcontemporary viral pandemic but also other diseases. The agonists of TLR7 havebeen utilized as vaccine adjuvants and antiviral agents. In this study, wehybridized a statistical learning-based QSAR model with molecular docking andmolecular dynamics simulation to extract new antiviral drugs by drug repurposing of the DrugBank database. First, we manually curated a dataset consisting of TLR7agonists. The molecular descriptors of these compounds were extracted, andfeature engineering was done to restrict the number of features to 45. We applieda statistically inspired modification of the partial least squares (SIMPLS)method to build our QSAR model. In the next stage, the DrugBank database wasvirtually screened structurally using molecular docking, and the top compoundsfor the guanosine binding site of TLR were identified. The result of moleculardocking was again screened by the ligand-based approach of QSAR to eliminatecompounds that do not display strong EC50 values by the previously trained model.We then subjected the final results to molecular dynamics simulation and comparedour compounds with imiquimod (an FDA-approved TLR7 agonist) and compound 1 (themost active compound against TLR7 in vitro, EC50 = 0.2 nM). Our results evidentlydemonstrate that cephalosporins and nucleotide analogues (especially acyclicnucleotide analogues such as adefovir and cidofovir) are computationally potentagonists of TLR7. We finally reviewed some publications about cephalosporinsthat, just like pieces of a puzzle, completed our conclusion.

AB  - With the emergence of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, drug repurposing studies havegained substantial importance. Combined with the efficacy of recent improvements in ligand- and target-based virtual screening approaches, virtual screening hasbecome faster and more productive than ever. In the current study, an FDA libraryof approved drugs and compounds under clinical investigation were screened fortheir antiviral activity using the antiviral therapeutic activity binary QSARmodel of the MetaCore/MetaDrug platform. Among 6733-compound collection, we found370 compounds with a normalized therapeutic activity value greater than a cutoff of 0.75. Only these selected compounds were used for molecular docking studiesagainst the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)). After initial short (10 ns)molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the top-50 docking scored compounds and following molecular mechanics generalized born surface area (MM/GBSA)calculations, top-10 compounds were subjected to longer (100 ns) MD simulationsand end-point MM/GBSA estimations. Our virtual screening protocol yieldedCefuroxime pivoxetil, an ester prodrug of second-generation cephalosporinantibiotic Cefuroxime, as being a considerable molecule for drug repurposingagainst the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro).

AB  - Despite COVID-19 turned into a pandemic, no approved drug for the treatment orglobally available vaccine is out yet. In such a global emergency, drugrepurposing approach that bypasses a costly and long-time demanding drugdiscovery process is an effective way in search of finding drugs for the COVID-19treatment. Recent studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 uses neuropilin-1 (NRP1) forhost entry. Here we took advantage of structural information of the NRP1 incomplex with C-terminal of spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 to identify drugs thatmay inhibit NRP1 and S protein interaction. U.S. Food and Drug Administration(FDA) approved drugs were screened using docking simulations. Among top drugs,well-tolerated drugs were selected for further analysis. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of drugs-NRP1 complexes were run for 100 ns to assess the persistencyof binding. MM/GBSA calculations from MD simulations showed that eltrombopag,glimepiride, sitagliptin, dutasteride, and ergotamine stably and strongly bind toNRP1. In silico Alanine scanning analysis revealed that Tyr(297), Trp(301), andTyr(353) amino acids of NRP1 are critical for drug binding. Validating the effectof drugs analyzed in this paper by experimental studies and clinical trials will expedite the drug discovery process for COVID-19.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, more than ever, data science has become a powerful weapon in combating an infectious disease epidemic and arguably any futureinfectious disease epidemic. Computer scientists, data scientists, physicists andmathematicians have joined public health professionals and virologists toconfront the largest pandemic in the century by capitalizing on the large-scale'big data' generated and harnessed for combating the COVID-19 pandemic. In thispaper, we review the newly born data science approaches to confronting COVID-19, including the estimation of epidemiological parameters, digital contact tracing, diagnosis, policy-making, resource allocation, risk assessment, mental healthsurveillance, social media analytics, drug repurposing and drug development. Wecompare the new approaches with conventional epidemiological studies, discusslessons we learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlight opportunities andchallenges of data science approaches to confronting future infectious diseaseepidemics. This article is part of the theme issue 'Data science approaches toinfectious disease surveillance'.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has shattered millions of lives globally and continues tobe a challenge to public health due to the emergence of variants of concern. Fearof secondary infections following COVID-19 has led to an escalation inantimicrobial use during the pandemic, while some antimicrobials have beenrepurposed as treatments for SARS-CoV-2, further driving antimicrobialresistance. India is one of the largest producers and consumers of antimicrobialsglobally, hence the task of curbing antimicrobial resistance is a huge challenge.Practices like empirical antimicrobial prescription and repurposing of drugs inclinical settings, self-medication and excessive use of antimicrobial hygieneproducts may have negatively impacted the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in India. However, the expanded production of antimicrobials and disinfectantsduring the pandemic in response to increased demand may have had an even greater impact on the threat of antimicrobial resistance through major impacts on theenvironment. The review provides an outline of the impact COVID-19 can have onantimicrobial resistance in clinical settings and the possible outcomes on theenvironment. This review calls for the upgrading of existing antimicrobialpolicies and emphasizes the need for research studies to understand the impact ofthe pandemic on antimicrobial resistance in India.

AB  - Ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug being investigated for repurposing againstsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Ivermectin showedin vitro activity against SARS-COV-2, but only at high concentrations. Thismeta-analysis investigated ivermectin in 23 randomized clinical trials (3349patients) identified through systematic searches of PUBMED, EMBASE, MedRxiv, and trial registries. The primary meta-analysis was carried out by excluding studies at a high risk of bias. Ivermectin did not show a statistically significanteffect on survival (risk ratio [RR], 0.90; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.42; P = .66) orhospitalizations (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.36 to 1.11; P = .11). Ivermectin displayed a borderline significant effect on duration of hospitalization in comparison withstandard of care (mean difference, -1.14 days; 95% CI, -2.27 to -0.00; P = .05). There was no significant effect of ivermectin on time to clinical recovery (mean difference, -0.57 days; 95% CI, -1.31 to 0.17; P = .13) or binary clinicalrecovery (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.50; P = .15). Currently, the World HealthOrganization recommends the use of ivermectin only inside clinical trials. Anetwork of large clinical trials is in progress to validate the results seen todate.

AB  - Interest in chloroquine, and its analog with a more favorable safety profile -hydroxychloroquine, in 2020 is certainly associated with the outbreak of a newcoronavirus infection, SARS-CoV-2. The high pathogenicity and lack of specificimmunity in the population caused the rapid spread of infection with anextraordinary increase in the burden on the health systems of many countries. In such conditions, it was necessary to quickly find and implement effective methodsof treatment and prevention. One of the most promising candidates for this rolewas hydroxychloroquine, as a multi-purpose drug with a well-studied safetyprofile and a rich history of use. The article describes some historical stagesof the study of chloroquine and its derivatives starting from the 19th centuryand ending in 2020. The experience of its use for the treatment of diseases such as malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, bronchial asthma, photosensitivityand skin porphyria was reviewed. Separately, some historical aspects of its usefor the treatment of viral and oncological diseases were considered. Thebibliometric method used in this scientific work clearly demonstrates thedynamics of the changing interest of the scientific community in chloroquine and its derivatives. Chloroquine and its derivatives can definitely be attributed to <<pharmaceutical centenarians>> with an intense life that continues.

AB  - Cancer care has become a challenge with the current COVID-19 pandemic scenario.Specially, cancers like small cell lung cancers (SCLC) are difficult to treateven in the normal situation due to their rapid growth and early metastasis. For such patients, treatment can't be compromised and care must be taken to ensuretheir minimum exposure to the ongoing spread of COVID-19 infection. For thisreason, in-house treatments are being suggested for these patients. Another issueis that symptoms of SCLC match well with that of COVID-19 infection. Hence, thedetection of COVID-19 may also get delayed leading to unnecessary complications. Thus, we have tried to investigate if the therapeutics that is currently used in lung cancer treatment can also act against SARS-CoV-2. If it is so, the sametreatment protocols can be continued even if the SCLC patient had contractedCOVID-19 without compromising the cancer care. For this, RNA dependent RNApolymerase (RdRP) from SARS-CoV-2 has been selected as drug target. Both docking and molecular dynamicssimulation analysis have indicated that Paclitaxel andDacomitinib may be explored as multi-target drugs for both SCLC andCOVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsiblefor millions of deaths around the world. To help contribute to the understanding of crucial knowledge and to further generate new hypotheses relevant toSARS-CoV-2 and human protein interactions, we make use of the informationabundant Biomine probabilistic database and extend the experimentally identified SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network in silico. We generatean extended network by integrating information from the Biomine database, the PPInetwork and other experimentally validated results. To generate novel hypotheses,we focus on the high-connectivity sub-communities that overlap most with theintegrated experimentally validated results in the extended network. Therefore,we propose a new data analysis pipeline that can efficiently compute coredecomposition on the extended network and identify dense subgraphs. We thenevaluate the identified dense subgraph and the generated hypotheses in threecontexts: literature validation for uncovered virus targeting genes and proteins,gene function enrichment analysis on subgraphs and literature support on drugrepurposing for identified tissues and diseases related to COVID-19. The majortypes of the generated hypotheses are proteins with their encoding genes and werank them by sorting their connections to the integrated experimentally validatednodes. In addition, we compile a comprehensive list of novel genes, and proteins potentially related to COVID-19, as well as novel diseases which might becomorbidities. Together with the generated hypotheses, our results provide novel knowledge relevant to COVID-19 for further validation.

AB  - SUMMARY: DeepKG is an end-to-end deep learning-based workflow that helpsresearchers automatically mine valuable knowledge in biomedical literature. Userscan utilize it to establish customized knowledge graphs in specified domains,thus facilitating in-depth understanding on disease mechanisms and applicationson drug repurposing and clinical research, etc. To improve the performance ofDeepKG, a cascaded hybrid information extraction framework (CHIEF) is developedfor training model of 3-tuple extraction, and a novel AutoML-based knowledgerepresentation algorithm (AutoTransX) is proposed for knowledge representationand inference. The system has been deployed in dozens of hospitals and extensive experiments strongly evidence the effectiveness. In the context of 144,900COVID-19 scholarly full-text literature, DeepKG generates a high-qualityknowledge graph with 7,980 entities and 43,760 3-tuples, a candidate drug list,and relevant animal experimental studies are being carried out. To acceleratemore studies, we make DeepKG publicly available and provide an online toolincluding the data of 3-tuples, potential drug list, question answering system,visualization platform. AVAILABILITY: Free to all users: http://covidkg.ai/.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformaticsonline.

LID - 10.1038/s41398-021-01724-w [doi]
AB  - Drug repurposing is an invaluable strategy to identify new uses for existing drugtherapies that overcome many of the time and financial costs associated withnovel drug development. The COVID-19 pandemic has driven an unprecedented surgein the development and use of bioinformatic tools to identify candidaterepurposable drugs. Using COVID-19 as a case study, we discuss examples ofmachine-learning and signature-based approaches that have been adapted to rapidlyidentify candidate drugs. The Library of Integrated Network-based Signatures(LINCS) and Connectivity Map (CMap) are commonly used repositories and have theadvantage of being amenable to use by scientists with limited bioinformatictraining. Next, we discuss how these recent advances in bioinformatic drugrepurposing approaches might be adapted to identify repurposable drugs for CNSdisorders. As the development of novel therapies that successfully target thecause of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders has stalled, there is apressing need for innovative strategies to treat these complex brain disorders.Bioinformatic approaches to identify repurposable drugs provide an excitingavenue of research that offer promise for improved treatments for CNS disorders.

AB  - COVID-19, for which no confirmed therapeutic agents are available, has claimedover 48,14,000 lives globally. A feasible and quicker method to resolve thisproblem may be 'drug repositioning'. We investigated selected FDA and WHO-EMLapproved drugs based on their previously promising potential as antivirals,antibacterials or antifungals. These drugs were docked onto the nsp12 protein,which reigns the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of SARS-CoV-2, a keytherapeutic target for coronaviruses. Docked complexes were reevaluated usingMM-GBSA analysis and the top three inhibitor-protein complexes were subjected to 100 ns long molecular dynamics simulation followed by another round of MM-GBSAanalysis. The RMSF plots, binding energies and the mode of physicochemicalinteraction of the active site of the protein with the drugs were evaluated.Suramin, Penciclovir, and Anidulafungin were found to bind to nsp12 with similar binding energies as that of Remdesivir, which has been used as a therapy forCOVID-19. In addition, recent experimental evidences indicate that these drugsexhibit antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Such evidence, along with thesignificant and varied physical interactions of these drugs with the key viralenzyme outlined in this investigation, indicates that they might have aprospective therapeutic potential in the treatment of COVID-19 as monotherapy or combination therapy with Remdesivir.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed a widespread effort to identify drugcandidates and biological targets of relevance to SARS-COV-2 infection, whichresulted in large numbers of publications on this subject. We have built theCOVID-19 Knowledge Extractor (COKE), a web application to extract, curate, andannotate essential drug-target relationships from the research literature onCOVID-19. SciBiteAI ontological tagging of the COVID Open Research Data set(CORD-19), a repository of COVID-19 scientific publications, was employed toidentify drug-target relationships. Entity identifiers were resolved throughlookup routines using UniProt and DrugBank. A custom algorithm was used toidentify co-occurrences of the target protein and drug terms, and confidencescores were calculated for each entity pair. COKE processing of the currentCORD-19 database identified about 3000 drug-protein pairs, including 29 uniqueproteins and 500 investigational, experimental, and approved drugs. Some of thesedrugs are presently undergoing clinical trials for COVID-19. The COKE repository and web application can serve as a useful resource for drug repurposing againstSARS-CoV-2. COKE is freely available at https://coke.mml.unc.edu/, and the codeis available at https://github.com/DnlRKorn/CoKE.

TI  - Interaction of Spike protein and lipid membrane of SARS-CoV-2 withUrsodeoxycholic acid, an in-silico analysis.
PG  - 22288
LID - 10.1038/s41598-021-01705-5 [doi]
AB  - Numerous repositioned drugs have been sought to decrease the severity ofSARS-CoV-2 infection. It is known that among its physicochemical properties,Ursodeoxycholic Acid (UDCA) has a reduction in surface tension and cholesterolsolubilization, it has also been used to treat cholesterol gallstones and viralhepatitis. In this study, molecular docking was performed with the SARS-CoV-2Spike protein and UDCA. In order to confirm this interaction, we used MolecularDynamics (MD) in "SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-UDCA". Using another system, we alsosimulated MD with six UDCA residues around the Spike protein at random, namingthis "SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-6UDCA". Finally, we evaluated the possibleinteraction between UDCA and different types of membranes, considering thepossible membrane conformation of SARS-CoV-2, this was named "SARS-CoV-2membrane-UDCA". In the "SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-UDCA", we found that UDCAexhibits affinity towards the central region of the Spike protein structure of - 386.35 kcal/mol, in a region with 3 alpha helices, which comprises residues from K986 to C1032 of each monomer. MD confirmed that UDCA remains attached andoccasionally forms hydrogen bonds with residues R995 and T998. In the presence ofUDCA, we observed that the distances between residues atoms OG1 and CG2 of T998in the monomers A, B, and C in the prefusion state do not change and remain at5.93 +/- 0.62 and 7.78 +/- 0.51 A, respectively, compared to the post-fusionstate. Next, in "SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-6UDCA", the three UDCA showed affinity towards different regions of the Spike protein, but only one of them remainedbound to the region between the region's heptad repeat 1 and heptad repeat 2 (HR1and HR2) for 375 ps of the trajectory. The RMSD of monomer C was the smallest of the three monomers with a value of 2.89 +/- 0.32, likewise, the smallest RMSF wasalso of the monomer C (2.25 +/- 056). In addition, in the simulation of"SARS-CoV-2 membrane-UDCA", UDCA had a higher affinity toward the virion-likemembrane; where three of the four residues remained attached once they were close(5 A, to the centre of mass) to the membrane by 30 ns. However, only one of them remained attached to the plasma-like membrane and this was in a cluster ofcholesterol molecules. We have shown that UDCA interacts in two distinct regions of Spike protein sequences. In addition, UDCA tends to stay bound to themembrane, which could potentially reduce the internalization of SARS-CoV-2 in thehost cell.

AB  - We present two machine learning approaches for drug repurposing. While we havedeveloped them for COVID-19, they are disease-agnostic. The two methodologies arecomplementary, targeting SARS-CoV-2 and host factors, respectively. Our firstapproach consists of a matrix factorization algorithm to rank broad-spectrumantivirals. Our second approach, based on network medicine, uses graph kernels torank drugs according to the perturbation they induce on a subnetwork of the humaninteractome that is crucial for SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication. Our experimentsshow that our top predicted broad-spectrum antivirals include drugs indicated forcompassionate use in COVID-19 patients; and that the ranking obtained by ourkernel-based approach aligns with experimental data. Finally, we present theCOVID-19 repositioning explorer (CoREx), an interactive online tool to explorethe interplay between drugs and SARS-CoV-2 host proteins in the context ofbiological networks, protein function, drug clinical use, and Connectivity Map.CoREx is freely available at: https://paccanarolab.org/corex/.

AB  - SARS-CoV2 infection results in a range of symptoms from mild pneumonia to cardiacarrhythmias, hyperactivation of the immune response, systemic organ failure anddeath. However, the mechanism of action has been hard to establish. Analysis ofsymptoms associated with COVID-19, the activity of repurposed drugs associatedwith lower death rates or antiviral activity in vitro and a small number ofstudies describing interventions, point to the importance of electrolyte, andparticularly potassium, homeostasis at both the cellular, and systemic level.Elevated urinary loss of potassium is associated with disease severity, and theresponse to electrolyte replenishment correlates with progression towardrecovery. These findings suggest possible diagnostic opportunities andtherapeutic interventions. They provide insights into comorbidities andmechanisms associated with infection by SARS-CoV2 and other RNA viruses thattarget the ACE2 receptor, and/or activate cytokine-mediated immune responses in apotassium-dependent manner.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has rapidly spread worldwide. Developingmethods to identify the therapeutic activity of drugs based on phenotypic datacan improve the efficiency of drug development. Here, a state-of-the-artmachine-learning method was used to identify drug mechanism of actions (MoAs)based on the cell image features of 1105 drugs in the LINCS database. As themulti-dimensional features of cell images are affected by non-experimentalfactors, the characteristics of similar drugs vary considerably, and it isdifficult to effectively identify the MoA of drugs as there is substantial noise.By applying the supervised information theoretic metric-learning (ITML)algorithm, a linear transformation made drugs with the same MoA aggregate. Byclustering drugs to communities and performing enrichment analysis, we found thattransferred image features were more conducive to the recognition of drug MoAs.Image features analysis showed that different features play important roles inidentifying different drug functions. Drugs that significantly affect cellsurvival or proliferation, such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, were more likely to be enriched in communities, whereas other drugs might be decentralized.Chloroquine and clomiphene, which block the entry of virus, were clustered intothe same community, indicating that similar MoA could be reflected by the cellimage. Overall, the findings of the present study laid the foundation for thediscovery of MoAs of new drugs, based on image data. In addition, it provided anew method of drug repurposing for COVID-19.

AB  - Deep learning significantly accelerates the drug discovery process, andcontributes to global efforts to stop the spread of infectious diseases. Besides enhancing the efficiency of screening of antimicrobial compounds against a broad spectrum of pathogens, deep learning has also the potential to efficiently andreliably identify drug candidates against Severe Acute Respiratory SyndromeCoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Consequently, deep learning has been successfullyused for the identification of a number of potential drugs against SARS-CoV-2,including Atazanavir, Remdesivir, Kaletra, Enalaprilat, Venetoclax, Posaconazole,Daclatasvir, Ombitasvir, Toremifene, Niclosamide, Dexamethasone, Indomethacin,Pralatrexate, Azithromycin, Palmatine, and Sauchinone. This mini-review discussesrecent advances and future perspectives of deep learning-based SARS-CoV-2 drugdiscovery.

TI  - Using genetics to understand the role of kidney function in COVID-19: a mendelianrandomization study.
PG  - 381
LID - 10.1186/s12882-021-02586-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Kidney dysfunction occurs in severe COVID-19, and is a predictor ofCOVID-19 mortality. Whether kidney dysfunction causes severe COVID-19, and hence is a target of intervention, or whether it is a symptom, is unclear becauseconventional observational studies are open to confounding. To obtainunconfounded estimates, we used Mendelian randomization to examine the role ofkidney function in severe COVID-19. METHODS: We used genome-wide significant,uncorrelated genetic variants to predict kidney function, in terms of estimatedglomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR),and then assessed whether people with genetically instrumented higher eGFR orlower UACR, an indication of better kidney function, had a lower risk of severeCOVID-19 (8779 cases, 1,001,875 controls), using the largest available cohortswith extensive genotyping. For comprehensiveness, we also examined their role in COVID-19 hospitalization (24,274 cases, 2,061,529 controls) and all COVID-19(1,12,612 cases, 2,474,079 controls). RESULTS: Genetically instrumented highereGFR was associated with lower risk of severe COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR) 0.90, 95%confidence interval (CI) 0.83, 0.98) but not related to COVID-19 hospitalization or infection. Genetically instrumented UACR was not related to COVID-19.CONCLUSIONS: Kidney function appears to be one of the key targets for severeCOVID-19 treatment. Use of available medications to improve kidney function, suchas antihypertensives, might be beneficial for COVID-19 treatment, with relevance to drug repositioning.

AB  - Pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is still pressing the healthcaresystems worldwide. Thus far, the lack of available COVID-19-targeted treatmentshas led scientists to look through drug repositioning practices and exploitation of available scientific evidence for potential efficient drugs that may blockbiological pathways of SARS-CoV-2. Till today, several molecules have emerged as promising pharmacological agents, and more than a few medication protocols areapplied during hospitalization. On the other hand, given the criticality of thedisease, it is important for healthcare providers, especially those in COVID-19clinics (i.e., nursing personnel and treating physicians), to recognize potentialdrug interactions that may lead to adverse drug reactions that may negativelyimpact the therapeutic outcome. In this review, focusing on patients withrespiratory diseases (i.e., asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) thatare treated also for COVID-19, we discuss possible drug interactions, theirunderlying pharmacological mechanisms, and possible clinical signs thathealthcare providers in COVID-19 clinics may need to acknowledge as adverse drug reactions due to drug-drug interactions.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has received global attention due to the seriousthreat it poses to public health. Since the outbreak in December 2019, millionsof people have been affected and its rapid global spread has led to an upsurge inthe search for treatment. To discover hit compounds that can be used alone or in combination with repositioned drugs, we first analyzed the pharmacokinetic andtoxicological properties of natural products from Brazil's semiarid region.After, we analyzed the site prediction and druggability of the SARS-CoV-2 mainprotease (Mpro), followed by docking and molecular dynamics simulation. The best SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complexes revealed that other sites were accessed, confirmingthat our approach could be employed as a suitable starting protocol for ligandprioritization, reinforcing the importance of catalytic cysteine-histidineresidues and providing new structural data that could increase the antiviraldevelopment mainly against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we selected 10 molecules that could be in vitro assayed in response to COVID-19. Two compounds (b01 and b02) suggest a better potential for interaction with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and could be furtherstudied.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most treatment guidelines for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)currently recommend tocilizumab in combination with dexamethasone in criticallyill patients who are exhibiting rapid respiratory decompensation. AIMS: Toproduce a critical review and summary of the pathway which led to the repurposingof tocilizumab for COVID-19 treatment, from in vitro observations to guidelinesrecommendations. SOURCES: All studies evaluating the effectiveness of tocilizumabto treat COVID-19 disease published between July 2020 and July 2021. CONTENT: Twolarge and methodologically well conducted observational studies, the TESEO andthe STOP COVID cohorts, showed a reduction in the risk of invasive mechanicalventilation or death in patients treated with tocilizumab as compared to standardof care in 2020. Concomitantly, and up to February 2021, a number of randomizedtrials (RCTs) with small sample sizes were showing discrepant results. These RCTshad a number of issues: small sample size, various designs and inclusioncriteria, and different dosages of tocilizumab used. The confidence interval ofthe meta-analytic estimate for the RCT results was consistent with the hypothesisof no efficacy of tocilizumab. In our opinion, this was mainly because themeta-analysis included small and heterogeneous studies. These results led to adelay in the inclusion of tocilizumab in guidelines which occurred only in thesummer of 2021. IMPLICATIONS: Although observational studies are unable tocontrol for unmeasured confounding, they can be put together quickly during apandemic and promptly provide important information. The large sample size allowsus to investigate effect measure modifiers and to better target interventions. Itis key that the effect size is somewhat large (RR > 2), all sources of bias areproperly accounted for, and the direct evidence is weighted against thesefactors. It appears to us that for tocilizumab, not having dismissed the results of carefully designed and analysed observational studies in 2020 could haveprevented many deaths over those months.

AB  - In the past 20 years, there have been several infectious disease outbreaks inhumans for which the causative agent has been a zoonotic coronavirus. Novelinfectious disease outbreaks, as illustrated by the current coronavirus disease2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, demand a rapid response in terms of identifyingeffective treatments for seriously ill patients. The repurposing of approveddrugs from other therapeutic areas is one of the most practical routes throughwhich to approach this. Here, we present a systematic network-based drugrepurposing methodology, which interrogates virus-human, human protein-proteinand drug-protein interactome data. We identified 196 approved drugs that areappropriate for repurposing against COVID-19 and 102 approved drugs against arelated coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV). We constructeda protein-protein interaction (PPI) network based on disease signatures fromCOVID-19 and SARS multi-omics datasets. Analysis of this PPI network uncoveredkey pathways. Of the 196 drugs predicted to target COVID-19 related pathways, 44 (hypergeometric p-value: 1.98e-04) are already in COVID-19 clinical trials,demonstrating the validity of our approach. Using an artificial neural network,we provide information on the mechanism of action and therapeutic value for each of the identified drugs, to facilitate their rapid repurposing into clinicaltrials.

AB  - Repurposing of existing drugs and drug candidates is an ideal approach toidentify new potential therapies for SARS-CoV-2 that can be tested without delay in human trials of infected patients. Here we applied a virtual screeningapproach using Autodock Vina and molecular dynamics simulation in tandem tocalculate binding energies for repurposed drugs against the SARS-CoV-2RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We thereby identified 80 promising compoundswith potential activity against SARS-Cov2, consisting of a mixture of antiviraldrugs, natural products and drugs with diverse modes of action. A substantialproportion of the top 80 compounds identified in this study had been shown byothers to have SARS-CoV-2 antiviral effects in vitro or in vivo, therebyvalidating our approach. Amongst our top hits not previously reported to haveSARS-CoV-2 activity, were eribulin, a macrocyclic ketone analogue of the marinecompound halichondrin B and an anticancer drug, the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor bemcentinib. Our top hits from our RdRp drug screen may not only haveutility in treating COVID-19 but may provide a useful starting point fortherapeutics against other coronaviruses. Hence, our modelling approachsuccessfully identified multiple drugs with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2RdRp.

AB  - Many patients infected with coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and NL63 that useACE2 receptors to infect cells, exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms and viralproteins are found in the human gastrointestinal tract, yet little is known aboutthe inflammatory and pathological effects of coronavirus infection on the humanintestine. Here, we used a human intestine-on-a-chip (Intestine Chip)microfluidic culture device lined by patient organoid-derived intestinalepithelium interfaced with human vascular endothelium to study host cellular and inflammatory responses to infection with NL63 coronavirus. These organoid-derivedintestinal epithelial cells dramatically increased their ACE2 protein levels whencultured under flow in the presence of peristalsis-like mechanical deformationsin the Intestine Chips compared to when cultured statically as organoids or inTranswell inserts. Infection of the intestinal epithelium with NL63 on-chip ledto inflammation of the endothelium as demonstrated by loss of barrier function,increased cytokine production, and recruitment of circulating peripheral bloodmononuclear cells (PBMCs). Treatment of NL63 infected chips with the approvedprotease inhibitor drug, nafamostat, inhibited viral entry and resulted in areduction in both viral load and cytokine secretion, whereas remdesivir, one ofthe few drugs approved for COVID19 patients, was not found to be effective and italso was toxic to the endothelium. This model of intestinal infection was alsoused to test the effects of other drugs that have been proposed for potentialrepurposing against SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, these data suggest that the humanIntestine Chip might be useful as a human preclinical model for studyingcoronavirus related pathology as well as for testing of potential anti-viral oranti-inflammatory therapeutics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of mycoses is often ineffective, usually prolonged, and hassome side effects. These facts highlight the importance of discovering newmolecules to treat fungal infections. OBJECTIVES: To search the Medicines forMalaria Venture COVID Box for drugs with antifungal activity. METHODS: Fourteenhuman pathogenic fungi were tested against the 160 drugs of this collection at1.0 microM concentration. We evaluated the ability of the drugs to impair fungal growth, their fungicidal nature, and morphological changes caused to cells.FINDINGS: Thirty-four molecules (21.25%) presented antifungal activity. Seven areantifungal drugs and one is the agricultural fungicide cycloheximide. The otherdrugs with antifungal activity included antibiotics (n = 3), antimalarials (n =4), antivirals (n = 2), antiparasitcs (n = 3), antitumor agents (n = 5), nervous system agents (n = 3), immunosuppressants (n = 3), antivomiting (n = 1),antiasthmatic (n = 1), and a genetic disorder agent (n = 1). Several of thesedrugs inhibited Histoplasma capsulatum and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis growth(15 and 20, respectively), while Fusarium solani was not affected by the drugstested. Most drugs were fungistatic, but niclosamide presented fungicidalactivity against the three dimorphic fungi tested. Cyclosporine affectedmorphology of Cryptococcus neoformans. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: These drugs representnew alternatives to the development of more accessible and effective therapies totreat human fungal infections.

AB  - Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, large in silico screening studiesand numerous in vitro studies have assessed the antiviral activity of variousdrugs on SARS-CoV-2. In the context of health emergency, drug repurposingrepresents the most relevant strategy because of the reduced time for approval byinternational medicines agencies, the low cost of development and the well-known toxicity profile of such drugs. Herein, we aim to review drugs with in vitroantiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, combined with molecular docking data andresults from preliminary clinical studies. Finally, when considering all theseprevious findings, as well as the possibility of oral administration, 11molecules consisting of nelfinavir, favipiravir, azithromycin, clofoctol,clofazimine, ivermectin, nitazoxanide, amodiaquine, heparin, chloroquine andhydroxychloroquine, show an interesting antiviral activity that could beexploited as possible drug candidates for COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious viral respiratoryillness. This illness is spurred on by a coronavirus known as SARS-associatedcoronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS was first detected in Asia in late February 2003.The genome of this virus is very similar to the SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the study of SARS-CoV disease and the identification of effective drugs to treat thisdisease can be new clues for the treatment of SARS-Cov-2. This study aimed todiscover novel potential drugs for SARS-CoV disease in order to treatingSARS-Cov-2 disease based on a novel systems biology approach. To this end, geneco-expression network analysis was applied. First, the gene co-expression networkwas reconstructed for 1441 genes, and then two gene modules were discovered assignificant modules. Next, a list of miRNAs and transcription factors that targetgene co-expression modules' genes were gathered from the valid databases, and twosub-networks formed of transcription factors and miRNAs were established.Afterward, the list of the drugs targeting obtained sub-networks' genes wasretrieved from the DGIDb database, and two drug-gene and drug-TF interactionnetworks were reconstructed. Finally, after conducting different networkanalyses, we proposed five drugs, including FLUOROURACIL, CISPLATIN, SIROLIMUS,CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE, and METHYLDOPA, as candidate drugs for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirustreatment. Moreover, ten miRNAs including miR-193b, miR-192, miR-215, miR-34a,miR-16, miR-16, miR-92a, miR-30a, miR-7, and miR-26b were found to be significantmiRNAs in treating SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from Wuhanin China before it spread to the entire globe. It causes coronavirus disease of2019 (COVID-19) where mostly individuals present mild symptoms, some remainasymptomatic and some show severe lung inflammation and pneumonia in the hostthrough the induction of a marked inflammatory 'cytokine storm'. New andefficacious vaccines have been developed and put into clinical practice in recordtime, however, there is a still a need for effective treatments for those who arenot vaccinated or remain susceptible to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant strains.Despite this, effective therapeutic interventions against COVID-19 remainelusive. Here, we have reviewed potential drugs for COVID-19 classified on thebasis of their mode of action. The mechanisms of action of each are discussed in detail to highlight the therapeutic targets that may help in reducing the global pandemic. The review was done up to July 2021 and the data was assessed throughthe official websites of WHO and CDC for collecting the information on theclinical trials. Moreover, the recent research papers were also assessed for the relevant data. The search was mainly based on keywords like Coronavirus,SARS-CoV-2, drugs (specific name of the drugs), COVID-19, clinical efficiency,safety profile, side-effects etc.This review outlines potential areas for future research into COVID-19 treatment strategies.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) is one of the most extensively exploited drugtargets for COVID-19. Structurally disparate compounds have been reported asM(pro) inhibitors, raising the question of their target specificity. To elucidatethe target specificity and the cellular target engagement of the claimed M(pro)inhibitors, we systematically characterize their mechanism of action using thecell-free FRET assay, the thermal shift-binding assay, the cell lysateProtease-Glo luciferase assay, and the cell-based FlipGFP assay. Collectively,our results have shown that majority of the M(pro) inhibitors identified fromdrug repurposing including ebselen, carmofur, disulfiram, and shikonin arepromiscuous cysteine inhibitors that are not specific to M(pro), whilechloroquine, oxytetracycline, montelukast, candesartan, and dipyridamole do notinhibit M(pro) in any of the assays tested. Overall, our study highlights theneed of stringent hit validation at the early stage of drug discovery.

AB  - More than one and half years have passed, as of August 2021, since the COVID-19caused by the novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 emerged in 2019. While therecent success of vaccine developments likely reduces the severe cases, there is still a strong requirement of safety and effective therapeutic drugs forovercoming the unprecedented situation. Here we review the recent progress andthe status of the drug discovery against COVID-19 with emphasizing astructure-based perspective. Structural data regarding the SARS-CoV-2 proteomehas been rapidly accumulated in the Protein Data Bank, and up to 68% of the totalamino acid residues encoded in the genome were covered by the structural data.Despite a global effort of in silico and in vitro screenings for drugrepurposing, there is only a limited number of drugs had been successfullyauthorized by drug regulation organizations. Although many approved drugs andnatural compounds, which exhibited antiviral activity in vitro, were consideredpotential drugs against COVID-19, a further multidisciplinary investigation isrequired for understanding the mechanisms underlying the antiviral effects of thedrugs.

AB  - As per the World Health Organization report, around 226 844 344 confirmedpositive cases and 4 666 334 deaths are reported till September 17, 2021 due tothe recent viral outbreak. A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) is responsible for the associated coronavirus disease(COVID-19), which causes serious or even fatal respiratory tract infection andyet no approved therapeutics or effective treatment is currently available tocombat the outbreak. Due to the emergency, the drug repurposing approach is beingexplored for COVID-19. In this study, we attempt to understand the potentialmechanism and also the effect of the approved antiviral drugs against theSARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). To understand the mechanism of inhibition of themalaria drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) against SARS-CoV-2, we performed molecular interaction studies. The studies revealed that HCQ docked at the active site ofthe Human ACE2 receptor as a possible way of inhibition. Our in silico analysisrevealed that the three drugs Lopinavir, Ritonavir, and Remdesivir showedinteraction with the active site residues of Mpro. During molecular dynamicssimulation, based on the binding free energy contributions, Lopinavir showedbetter results than Ritonavir and Remdesivir.

AB  - The main protease (Mpro or 3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 virus is a cysteine enzymecritical for viral replication and transcription, thus indicating a potentialtarget for antiviral therapy. A recent repurposing effort has identified ebselen,a multifunctional drug candidate as an inhibitor of Mpro. Our docking of ebselen to the binding pocket of Mpro crystal structure suggests a noncovalentinteraction for improvement of potency, antiviral activity and selectivity. Totest this hypothesis, we designed and synthesized ebselen derivatives aimed atenhancing their non-covalent bonds within Mpro. The inhibition of Mpro by ebselenderivatives (0.3 muM) was screened in both HPLC and FRET assays. Nine ebselenderivatives (EBs) exhibited stronger inhibitory effect on Mpro with IC50 of0.07-0.38 muM. Further evaluation of three derivatives showed that EB2-7exhibited the most potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 viral replication with an IC50value of 4.08 microM in HPAepiC cells, as compared to the prototype ebselen at24.61 muM. Mechanistically, EB2-7 functions as a noncovalent Mpro inhibitor inLC-MS/MS assay. Taken together, our identification of ebselen derivatives withimproved antiviral activity may lead to developmental potential for treatment of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - In contrast to the extensive research about viral protein-host proteininteractions that has revealed major insights about how RNA viruses engage withhost cells during infection, few studies have examined interactions between host factors and viral RNAs (vRNAs). Here, we profiled vRNA-host protein interactomes for three RNA virus pathogens (SARS-CoV-2, Zika, and Ebola viruses) usingChIRP-MS. Comparative interactome analyses discovered both common andvirus-specific host responses and vRNA-associated proteins that variously promoteor restrict viral infection. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 binds and hijacks the hostfactor IGF2BP1 to stabilize vRNA and augment viral translation. Ourinteractome-informed drug repurposing efforts identified several FDA-approveddrugs (e.g., Cepharanthine) as broad-spectrum antivirals in cells and hACE2transgenic mice. A co-treatment comprising Cepharanthine and Trifluoperazine was highly potent against the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant. Thus, ourstudy illustrates the scientific and medical discovery utility of adopting acomparative vRNA-host protein interactome perspective.

AB  - Auranofin (AF), a gold compound, has been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA)for more than 40 years; however, its mechanism of action remains unknown. Werevealed that AF inhibited the induction of proinflammatory proteins and theirmRNAs by the inflammatory stimulants, cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxidesynthase, and their upstream regulator, NF-kappaB. AF also activated the proteinsperoxyredoxin-1, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, and NF-E2-related factor 2,and inhibited thioredoxin reductase, all of which are involved in oxidative orelectrophilic stress under physiological conditions. Although the cell membranewas previously considered to be permeable to AF because of its hydrophobicity,the mechanisms responsible for transporting AF into and out of cells as well asits effects on the uptake and excretion of other drugs have not yet beenelucidated. Antibodies for cytokines have recently been employed in the treatmentof RA, which has had an impact on the use of AF. Trials to repurpose AF as arisk-controlled agent to treat cancers or infectious diseases, including severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2/coronavirus disease 2019, are ongoing.Novel gold compounds are also under development as anti-cancer and anti-infectionagents.

AB  - The development of vaccines for the treatment of COVID-19 is paving the way fornew hope. Despite this, the risk of the virus mutating into a vaccine-resistantvariant still persists. As a result, the demand of efficacious drugs to treatCOVID-19 is still pertinent. To this end, scientists continue to identify andrepurpose marketed drugs for this new disease. Many of these drugs are currently undergoing clinical trials and, so far, only one has been officially approved by FDA. Drug repurposing is a much faster route to the clinic than standard drugdevelopment of novel molecules, nevertheless in a pandemic this process is still not fast enough to halt the spread of the virus. Artificial intelligence hasalready played a large part in hastening the drug discovery process, not only by facilitating the selection of potential drug candidates but also in monitoringthe pandemic and enabling faster diagnosis of patients. In this chapter, we focuson the impact and challenges that artificial intelligence has demonstrated thusfar with respect to drug repurposing of therapeutics for the treatment ofCOVID-19.

AB  - As a part of the efforts to quickly develop pharmaceutical treatments forCOVID-19 through repurposing existing drugs, some researchers around the worldhave combined the recently released crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) incomplex with a covalently bonded inhibitor with virtual screening proceduresemploying molecular docking approaches. In this context, protease inhibitors(PIs) clinically available and currently used to treat infectious diseases,particularly viral ones, are relevant sources of promising drug candidates toinhibit the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro), a key viral enzyme involved in crucial eventsduring its life cycle. In the present perspective, we summarized the publishedstudies showing the promising use of HIV and HCV PIs as potential repurposingdrugs against the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro).

AB  - The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) became a worldwide pandemic withcurrently no approved effective antiviral drug. Flux balance analysis (FBA) is anefficient method to analyze metabolic networks. Here, FBA was applied on humanlung cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) to reposition metabolic drugs and drug combinations against thevirus replication within the host tissue. Making use of expression datasets ofinfected lung tissue, genome-scale COVID-19-specific metabolic models werereconstructed. Then, host-specific essential genes and gene pairs were determinedthrough in silico knockouts that permit reducing the viral biomass productionwithout affecting the host biomass. Key pathways that are associated withCOVID-19 severity in lung tissue are related to oxidative stress, ferroptosis,and pyrimidine metabolism. By in silico screening of Food and Drug Administration(FDA)-approved drugs on the putative disease-specific essential genes and genepairs, 85 drugs and 52 drug combinations were predicted as promising candidatesfor COVID-19 (https://github.com/sysbiolux/DCcov).

AB  - With the development of structural biology and data mining, computer-aided drugdesign (CADD) has been playing an important role in all aspects of new drugdevelopment. Reverse docking, a method of virtual screening based on moleculardocking in CADD, is widely used in drug repositioning, drug rescue, andtraditional Chinese medicine (TCM) research, for it can search for macromoleculartargets that can bind to a given ligand molecule. This review revealed theprinciple of reverse docking, summarized common target protein databases anddocking procedures, and enumerated the applications of reverse docking in drugrepositioning, adverse drug reactions, traditional Chinese medicine, andcoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment. Hope our work can give someinspiration to researchers engaged in drug development.

AB  - Responding quickly to emerging respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 thecausative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, is essential to stop uncontrolled spread of these pathogens and mitigate their socio-economicimpact globally. This can be achieved through drug repurposing, which tacklesinherent time- and resource-consuming processes associated with conventional drugdiscovery and development. In this review, we examine key preclinical andclinical therapeutic and prophylactic approaches that have been applied fortreatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We break these strategies down into virus-versus host-targeting and discuss their reported efficacy, advantages, anddisadvantages. Importantly, we highlight emerging evidence on application of hostserine protease-inhibiting anticoagulants, such as nafamostat mesylate, as apotentially powerful therapy to inhibit virus activation and offercross-protection against multiple strains of coronavirus, lower inflammatoryresponse independent of its antiviral effect, and modulate clotting problems seenin COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - Treatment options for COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, remain limited.Understanding viral pathogenesis at the molecular level is critical to developeffective therapy. Some recent studies have explored SARS-CoV-2-host interactomesand provided great resources for understanding viral replication. However, hostproteins that functionally associate with SARS-CoV-2 are localized in thecorresponding subnetwork within the comprehensive human interactome. Therefore,constructing a downstream network including all potential viral receptors, hostcell proteases, and cofactors is necessary and should be used as an additionalcriterion for the validation of critical host machineries used for viralprocessing. This study applied both affinity purification mass spectrometry(AP-MS) and the complementary proximity-based labeling MS method (BioID-MS) on 29viral ORFs and 18 host proteins with potential roles in viral replication to map the interactions relevant to viral processing. The analysis yields a list of 693 hub proteins sharing interactions with both viral baits and host baits andrevealed their biological significance for SARS-CoV-2. Those hub proteins thenserved as a rational resource for drug repurposing via a virtual screeningapproach. The overall process resulted in the suggested repurposing of 59compounds for 15 protein targets. Furthermore, antiviral effects of somecandidate drugs were observed in vitro validation using image-based drug screenwith infectious SARS-CoV-2. In addition, our results suggest that the antiviralactivity of methotrexate could be associated with its inhibitory effect onspecific protein-protein interactions.

AB  - Tremendous progress has been made to control the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, effective therapeutic options are still rare. Drugrepurposing and combination represent practical strategies to address this urgentunmet medical need. Viruses, including coronaviruses, are known to hijack hostmetabolism to facilitate viral proliferation, making targeting host metabolism a promising antiviral approach. Here, we describe an integrated analysis of 12published in vitro and human patient gene expression datasets on SARS-CoV-2infection using genome-scale metabolic modeling (GEM), revealing complicated hostmetabolism reprogramming during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We next applied theGEM-based metabolic transformation algorithm to predict anti-SARS-CoV-2 targetsthat counteract the virus-induced metabolic changes. We successfully validatedthese targets using published drug and genetic screen data and by performing ansiRNA assay in Caco-2 cells. Further generating and analyzing RNA-sequencing dataof remdesivir-treated Vero E6 cell samples, we predicted metabolic targets actingin combination with remdesivir, an approved anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug. Our studyprovides clinical data-supported candidate anti-SARS-CoV-2 targets for futureevaluation, demonstrating host metabolism targeting as a promising antiviralstrategy.

AB  - This review analyzes the published literature linking the different mechanismsfocused on oxidative stress and inflammation that contribute to COVID-19 disease severity. The objective is to bring together potential proinflammatory mechanismsof COVID-19 pathogenesis and address mitigation strategies using naturallyoccurring compounds and FDA-approved drugs. Outstanding questions addressedinclude the following: What is the mechanistic basis for linking enhancedvulnerability in COVID-19 to increased oxidative damage and proinflammatorymediators (e.g., cytokines), especially in high-risk people? Can we repurposeanti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents to mitigate inflammation inCOVID-19 patients? How does 2-deoxy-d-glucose function as an anti-COVID drug?COVID-19, cancer biology, and immunotherapy share many mechanistic similarities. Repurposing drugs that already have been FDA-approved for mitigating inflammationand immunosuppression in cancer may be a way to counteract disease severity,progression, and chronic inflammation in COVID-19. What are the long-term effectsof reactive oxygen species-inducing immune cells and sustained inflammation inso-called long-haulers (long COVID) after recovery from COVID-19? Can we usemitochondria-targeted agents prophylactically to prevent inflammation and boostimmunity in long-haulers? Addressing the oxidative chemical biology of COVID-19and the mechanistic commonalities with cancer may provide new insightspotentially leading to appropriate clinical trials and new treatments.

LID - 10.1002/cpt.2463 [doi]
AB  - Repurposing approved drugs may rapidly establish effective interventions during apublic health crisis. This has yielded immunomodulatory treatments for severecoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but repurposed antivirals have not beensuccessful to date because of redundancy of the target in vivo or suboptimalexposures at studied doses. Nitazoxanide is a US Food and Drug Administration(FDA) approved antiparasitic medicine, that physiologically-based pharmacokinetic(PBPK) modeling has indicated may provide antiviral concentrations across thedosing interval, when repurposed at higher than approved doses. Within the AGILE trial platform (NCT04746183) an open label, adaptive, phase I trial in healthyadult participants was undertaken with high-dose nitazoxanide. Participantsreceived 1,500 mg nitazoxanide orally twice-daily with food for 7 days. Primaryoutcomes were safety, tolerability, optimum dose, and schedule. Intensivepharmacokinetic (PK) sampling was undertaken day 1 and 5 with minimumconcentration (Cmin ) sampling on days 3 and 7. Fourteen healthy participantswere enrolled between February 18 and May 11, 2021. All 14 doses were completedby 10 of 14 participants. Nitazoxanide was safe and with no significant adverseevents. Moderate gastrointestinal disturbance (loose stools or diarrhea) occurredin 8 participants (57.1%), with urine and sclera discoloration in 12 (85.7%) and 9 (64.3%) participants, respectively, without clinically significant bilirubinelevation. This was self-limiting and resolved upon drug discontinuation. PBPKpredictions were confirmed on day 1 but with underprediction at day 5. MedianCmin was above the in vitro target concentration on the first dose and maintainedthroughout. Nitazoxanide administered at 1,500 mg b.i.d. with food was safe with acceptable tolerability a phase Ib/IIa study is now being initiated in patientswith COVID-19.

LID - 10.3390/ncrna7040060 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) has devastated global healthcare and economies. Despite the stabilization ofinfectivity rates in some developed nations, several countries are still underthe grip of the pathogenic viral mutants that are causing a significant increase in infections and hospitalization. Given this urgency, targeting of key hostfactors regulating SARS-CoV-2 life cycle is postulated as a novel strategy tocounter the virus and its associated pathological outcomes. In this regard, Poly (ADP)-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is being increasingly recognized as a possibletarget. PARP-1 is well studied in human diseases such as cancer, central nervous system (CNS) disorders and pathology of RNA viruses. Emerging evidence indicates that regulation of PARP-1 by non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs is integral tocell survival, redox balance, DNA damage response, energy homeostasis, andseveral other cellular processes. In this short perspective, we summarize therecent findings on the microRNA/PARP-1 axis and its therapeutic potential forCOVID-19 pathologies.

AB  - This review makes a critical evaluation of 61 peer-reviewed manuscripts that use a docking step in a virtual screening (VS) protocol to predict SARS-CoV-2 M-pro(M-pro) inhibitors in approved or investigational drugs. Various manuscriptspredict different compounds, even when they use a similar initial dataset andmethodology, and most of them do not validate their methodology or results. Inaddition, a set of known 150 SARS-CoV-2 M-pro inhibitors extracted from theliterature and a second set of 81 M-pro inhibitors and 113 inactive compoundsobtained from the COVID Moonshot project were used to evaluate the reliability ofusing docking scores as feasible predictors of the potency of a SARS-CoV-2 M-pro inhibitor. Using two SARS-CoV-2 M-pro structures and five protein-ligand docking programs, we proved that the correlation between the pIC50 and docking scores is not good. Neither was any correlation found between the pIC50 and the Gcalculated with an MM-GBSA method. When a group of experimentally known inactive compounds was added, neither the docking scores or the G were able to distinguishbetween compounds with or without M-pro experimental inhibitory activity.Performances improved when covalent and noncovalent inhibitors were treatedseparately, but were not good enough to fully support using a docking score as a cutoff value for selecting new putative M-pro inhibitors or predicting therelative bioactivity of a compound by comparison with a reference compound. Thetwo sets of known SARS-CoV-2 M-pro inhibitors presented here could be used forvalidating future VS protocols which aim to predict M-pro inhibitors.

TI  - Effect of Ivermectin and Atorvastatin on Nuclear Localization of Importin Alphaand Drug Target Expression Profiling in Host Cells from Nasopharyngeal Swabs ofSARS-CoV-2- Positive Patients.

AB  - Nuclear transport and vesicle trafficking are key cellular functions involved in the pathogenesis of RNA viruses. Among other pleiotropic effects onvirus-infected host cells, ivermectin (IVM) inhibits nuclear transport mechanismsmediated by importins and atorvastatin (ATV) affects actin cytoskeleton-dependenttrafficking controlled by Rho GTPases signaling. In this work, we first analyzed the response to infection in nasopharyngeal swabs from SARS-CoV-2-positive and-negative patients by assessing the gene expression of the respective host celldrug targets importins and Rho GTPases. COVID-19 patients showed alterations inKPNA3, KPNA5, KPNA7, KPNB1, RHOA, and CDC42 expression compared with non-COVID-19patients. An in vitro model of infection with Poly(I:C), a synthetic analog ofviral double-stranded RNA, triggered NF-kappaB activation, an effect that washalted by IVM and ATV treatment. Importin and Rho GTPases gene expression wasalso impaired by these drugs. Furthermore, through confocal microscopy, weanalyzed the effects of IVM and ATV on nuclear to cytoplasmic importin alphadistribution, alone or in combination. Results showed a significant inhibition ofimportin alpha nuclear accumulation under IVM and ATV treatments. These findings confirm transcriptional alterations in importins and Rho GTPases upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and point to IVM and ATV as valid drugs to impair nuclear localization of importin alpha when used at clinically-relevant concentrations.

LID - 10.3390/v13102082 [doi]
AB  - We report the in vitro efficacy of ion-channel inhibitors amantadine, memantineand rimantadine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2). In VeroE6 cells, rimantadine was most potent followed by memantine and amantadine (50% effective concentrations: 36, 80 and 116 microM,respectively). Rimantadine also showed the highest selectivity index, followed byamantadine and memantine (17.3, 12.2 and 7.6, respectively). Similar results wereobserved in human hepatoma Huh7.5 and lung carcinoma A549-hACE2 cells. Inhibitorsinteracted in a similar antagonistic manner with remdesivir and had a similarbarrier to viral escape. Rimantadine acted mainly at the viral post-entry leveland partially at the viral entry level. Based on these results, rimantadineshowed the most promise for treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Host-directed therapy (HDT) is gaining traction as a strategy to combatinfectious diseases caused by viruses and intracellular bacteria, but itsimplementation in the context of parasitic diseases has received less attention. Here, we provide a brief overview of this field and advocate HDT as a promisingstrategy for antimalarial intervention based on untapped targets. HDT provides a basis from which repurposed drugs could be rapidly deployed and is likely tostrongly limit the emergence of resistance. This strategy can be applied to anyintracellular pathogen and is particularly well placed in situations in whichrapid identification of treatments is needed, such as emerging infections andpandemics, as starkly illustrated by the current COVID-19 crisis.

AB  - Outbreak of infectious diseases imposes a serious threat to human population and also causes a catastrophic impact on global economy. Animal coronaviruses remain as one of the intriguing problems, known to cause deadly viral diseases oneconomically important animal population, and also these infections may spread toother animals and humans. Through isolation of the infected animals from othersand providing appropriate treatment using antiviral drugs, it is possible toprevent the virus transmission from animals to other species. In recent times,antiviral drug-resistant strains are being emerged as a deadly virus which areknown to cause pandemic. To overcome this, nanoparticles-based formulations aredeveloped as antiviral agent which attacks the animal coronaviruses at multiplesites in the virus replication cycle. Nanovaccines are also being formulated toprotect the animals from coronaviruses. Nanoformulations contain particles of oneor more dimensions in nano-scale (few nanometers to 1000 nm), which could beinorganic or organic in nature. This review presents the comprehensive outline ofthe nanotechnology-based therapeutics formulated against animal coronaviruses,which includes the nanoparticles-based antiviral formulations andnanoparticles-based adjuvant vaccines. The mechanism of action of thesenanoparticles-based antivirals against animal coronavirus is also discussed usingrelevant examples. In addition, the scope of repurposing the existingnano-enabled antivirals and vaccines to combat the coronavirus infections inanimals is elaborated.

AB  - COVID-19 is an unprecedented pandemic threatening global health, and variantswere discovered rapidly after the pandemic. The two variants, namely theSARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and P.1 (Gamma), were formed by the mutations in thereceptor binding domain of spike glycoprotein (SGP). These two variants are knownto possess a high binding affinity with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.Amidst the rapid spread of these mutant strains, research and development ofnovel molecules become tedious and labour-intensive. Imidazole and benzimidazole scaffolds were selected in this study based on their unique structural featuresand electron-rich environment, resulting in increased affinity against a variety of therapeutic targets. In the current study, imidazole- and benzimidazole-based anti-parasitic drugs are repurposed against SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Gamma variantspike glycoproteins using computational strategies. Out of the screened 15molecules, flubendazole and mebendazole have exhibited promising binding featuresto the two receptors (PDB ID: 7NEH and 7NXC), as evidenced by their glide scoreand binding free energy. The results are compared with that of the two standarddrugs, remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine. Flubendazole and mebendazole havebecome convenient treatment options against mutant lineages of SARS-CoV-2. Theedge of the flubendazole was further established by its stability in MDsimulation conducted for 100 ns employing GROMACS software. Further, in vitro andin vivo studies are essential to understand, if flubendazole and mebendazoleindeed hold the promise to manage SARS-CoV-2 mutant stains.

AB  - Ivermectin (IVM) is an FDA approved macrocyclic lactone compound traditionallyused to treat parasitic infestations and has shown to have antiviral potentialfrom previous in-vitro studies. Currently, IVM is commercially available as aveterinary drug but have also been applied in humans to treat onchocerciasis(river blindness - a parasitic worm infection) and strongyloidiasis (aroundworm/nematode infection). In light of the recent pandemic, the repurposingof IVM to combat SARS-CoV-2 has acquired significant attention. Recently, IVM hasbeen proven effective in numerous in-silico and molecular biology experimentsagainst the infection in mammalian cells and human cohort studies. One promising study had reported a marked reduction of 93% of released virion and 99.98%unreleased virion levels upon administration of IVM to Vero-hSLAM cells. IVM'smode of action centres around the inhibition of the cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttlingof viral proteins by disrupting the Importin heterodimer complex (IMPalpha/beta1)and downregulating STAT3, thereby effectively reducing the cytokine storm.Furthermore, the ability of IVM to block the active sites of viral 3CLpro and Sprotein, disrupts important machinery such as viral replication and attachment.This review compiles all the molecular evidence to date, in review of theantiviral characteristics exhibited by IVM. Thereafter, we discuss IVM'smechanism and highlight the clinical advantages that could potentially contributetowards disabling the viral replication of SARS-CoV-2. In summary, the collectivereview of recent efforts suggests that IVM has a prophylactic effect and would bea strong candidate for clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - A Drug Repurposing Approach for Antimalarials Interfering with SARS-CoV-2 SpikeProtein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and Human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2(ACE2).
LID - 954 [pii]

AB  - Host cell invasion by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) is mediated by the interaction of the viral spike protein (S) withhuman angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through the receptor-binding domain (RBD). In this work, computational and experimental techniques were combined toscreen antimalarial compounds from different chemical classes, with the aim ofidentifying small molecules interfering with the RBD-ACE2 interaction and,consequently, with cell invasion. Docking studies showed that the compoundsinterfere with the same region of the RBD, but different interaction patternswere noted for ACE2. Virtual screening indicated pyronaridine as the mostpromising RBD and ACE2 ligand, and molecular dynamics simulations confirmed thestability of the predicted complex with the RBD. Bio-layer interferometry showed that artemisone and methylene blue have a strong binding affinity for RBD (KD =0.363 and 0.226 muM). Pyronaridine also binds RBD and ACE2 in vitro (KD = 56.8and 51.3 muM). Overall, these three compounds inhibit the binding of RBD to ACE2 in the muM range, supporting the in silico data.

AB  - Small molecule inhibitors have previously been investigated in different studies as possible therapeutics in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the current drug repurposing study, we identified the leukotriene (D4) receptor antagonist montelukast as a novel agent thatsimultaneously targets two important drug targets of SARS-CoV-2. We initiallydemonstrated the dual inhibition profile of montelukast through multiscalemolecular modeling studies. Next, we characterized its effect on both targets by different in vitro experiments including the enzyme (main protease)inhibition-based assay, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, pseudovirusneutralization on HEK293T/hACE2+TMPRSS2, and virus neutralization assay usingxCELLigence MP real-time cell analyzer. Our integrated in silico and in vitroresults confirmed the dual potential effect of montelukast both on the mainprotease enzyme inhibition and virus entry into the host cell (spike/ACE2). Thevirus neutralization assay results showed that SARS-CoV-2 virus activity wasdelayed with montelukast for 20 h on the infected cells. The rapid use of newsmall molecules in the pandemic is very important today. Montelukast, whosepharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties are very well characterized andhas been widely used in the treatment of asthma since 1998, should urgently becompleted in clinical phase studies and, if its effect is proved in clinicalphase studies, it should be used against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in thelate 2019 has caused a devastatingglobal pandemic of the severe pneumonia-like disease coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19). Although vaccines have been and are being developed, they are notaccessible to everyone and not everyone can receive these vaccines. Also, ittypically takes more than 10 years until a new therapeutic agent is approved for usage. Therefore, repurposing of known drugs can lend itself well as a keyapproach for significantly expediting the development of new therapies forCOVID-19. METHODS: We have incorporated machine learning-based computationaltools and in silico models into the drug discovery process to predict Adsorption,Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) profiles of 90potential drugs for COVID-19 treatment identified from two independent studiesmainly with the purpose of mitigating late-phase failures because of inferiorpharmacokinetics and toxicity. RESULTS: Here, we summarize the cardiotoxicity andgeneral toxicity profiles of 90 potential drugs for COVID-19 treatment andoutline the risks of repurposing and propose a stratification of patientsaccordingly. We shortlist a total of five compounds based on their non-toxicproperties. CONCLUSION: In summary, this manuscript aims to provide a potentiallyuseful source of essential knowledge on toxicity assessment of 90 compounds forhealthcare practitioners and researchers to find off-label alternatives for thetreatment for COVID-19. The majority of the molecules discussed in thismanuscript have already moved into clinical trials and thus their knownpharmacological and human safety profiles are expected to facilitate a fast trackpreclinical and clinical assessment for treating COVID-19.

AB  - Drug repurposing is an attractive option for identifying new treatmentstrategies, in particular in extraordinary situations of urgent need such as the current coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Recently, the World Health Organization announced testing of three drugs as potential Covid-19 therapeutics that are known for their dampening effect on the immune system. Thus, theunderlying concept of selecting these drugs is to temper the potentiallylife-threatening overshooting of the immune system reacting to severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This viewpointdiscusses the possibility that the impact of these and other drugs on autophagycontributes to their therapeutic effect by hampering the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.

AB  - This analysis presents a systematic evaluation of the extent of therapeuticopportunities that can be obtained from drug repurposing by connecting drugtargets with disease genes. When using FDA-approved indications as a referencelevel we found that drug repurposing can offer an average of an 11-fold increase in disease coverage, with the maximum number of diseases covered per drug beingincreased from 134 to 167 after extending the drug targets with their highconfidence first neighbors. Additionally, by network analysis to connect drugs todisease modules we found that drugs on average target 4 disease modules, yet the similarity between disease modules targeted by the same drug is generally low andthe maximum number of disease modules targeted per drug increases from 158 to 229when drug targets are neighbor-extended. Moreover, our results highlight thatdrug repurposing is more dependent on target proteins being shared betweendiseases than on polypharmacological properties of drugs. We apply our drugrepurposing and network module analysis to COVID-19 and show that Fostamatinib isthe drug with the highest module coverage.

AB  - COVID-19, an acute viral pneumonia, has emerged as a devastating pandemic. Drugrepurposing allows researchers to find different indications of FDA-approved orinvestigational drugs. In this current study, a sequence of pharmacophore andmolecular modeling-based screening against COVID-19 M(pro) (PDB: 6LU7) suggested a subset of drugs, from the Drug Bank database, which may have antiviralactivity. A total of 44 out of 8823 of the most promising virtual hits from theDrug Bank were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation experiments to explore the strength of their interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) active site. MDfindings point toward three drugs (DB04020, DB12411, and DB11779) with very lowrelative free energies for SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) with interactions at His41 andMet49. MD simulations identified an additional interaction with Glu166, whichenhanced the binding affinity significantly. Therefore, Glu166 could be aninteresting target for structure-based drug design. Quantitativestructural-activity relationship analysis was performed on the 44 most promising hits from molecular docking-based virtual screening. Partial least squareregression accurately predicted the values of independent drug candidates'binding energy with impressively high accuracy. Finally, the EC50 and CC50 of 10 drug candidates were measured against SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. Nilotinib andbemcentinib had EC50 values of 2.6 and 1.1 muM, respectively. In summary, theresults of our computer-aided drug design provide a roadmap for rational drugdesign of M(pro) inhibitors and the discovery of certified medications asCOVID-19 antiviral therapeutics.

This reviewdescribes a drug repurposing process that is based on a new data-driven approach:we put forward five information paths that associate COVID-19-related genes andCOVID-19 symptoms with drugs that directly target these gene products, thattarget the symptoms or that treat diseases that are symptomatically orgenetically similar to COVID-19. The intersection of the five information pathsresults in a list of 13 drugs that we suggest as potential candidates againstCOVID-19. In addition, we have found information in published studies and inclinical trials that support the therapeutic potential of the drugs in our final list.

AB  - As hypoxia is a major driver for the pathophysiology of COVID-19, it is crucialto characterize the hypoxic response at the cellular and molecular levels. Inorder to augment drug repurposing with the identification of appropriatemolecular targets, investigations on therapeutics preventing hypoxic cell damage is required. In this work, we propose a hypoxia model based on alveolar lungepithelial cells line using chemical inducer, CoCl2 that can be used for testing calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Since recent studies suggested that CCBs mayreduce the infectivity of SARS-Cov-2, we specifically select FDA approved calciumchannel blocker, nifedipine for the study. First, we examined hypoxia-inducedcell morphology and found a significant increase in cytosolic calcium levels,mitochondrial calcium overload as well as ROS production in hypoxic A549 cells.Secondly, we demonstrate the protective behaviour of nifedipine for cells thatare already subjected to hypoxia through measurement of cell viability as well as4D imaging of cellular morphology and nuclear condensation. Thirdly, we show thatthe protective effect of nifedipine is achieved through the reduction ofcytosolic calcium, mitochondrial calcium, and ROS generation. Overall, we outlinea framework for quantitative analysis of mitochondrial calcium and ROS using 3Dimaging in laser scanning confocal microscopy and the open-source image analysis platform ImageJ. The proposed pipeline was used to visualize mitochondrialcalcium and ROS level in individual cells that provide an understanding ofmolecular targets. Our findings suggest that the therapeutic value of nifedipine may potentially be evaluated in the context of COVID-19 therapeutic trials.

AB  - Background: Recently, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acuterespiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has affected more than 200 countriesand lead to enormous losses. This study systematically reviews the application ofArtificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in COVID-19, especially for diagnosis,estimation of epidemic trends, prognosis, and exploration of effective and safedrugs and vaccines; and discusses the potential limitations. Methods: We reportthis systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for SystematicReviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched PubMed, Embase and theCochrane Library from inception to 19 September 2020 for published studies of AI applications in COVID-19. We used PROBAST (prediction model risk of biasassessment tool) to assess the quality of literature related to the diagnosis andprognosis of COVID-19. We registered the protocol (PROSPERO CRD42020211555).Results: We included 78 studies: 46 articles discussed AI-assisted diagnosis for COVID-19 with total accuracy of 70.00 to 99.92%, sensitivity of 73.00 to 100.00%,specificity of 25 to 100.00%, and area under the curve of 0.732 to 1.000.Fourteen articles evaluated prognosis based on clinical characteristics athospital admission, such as clinical, laboratory and radiologicalcharacteristics, reaching accuracy of 74.4 to 95.20%, sensitivity of 72.8 to98.00%, specificity of 55 to 96.87% and AUC of 0.66 to 0.997 in predictingcritical COVID-19. Nine articles used AI models to predict the epidemic of theCOVID-19, such as epidemic peak, infection rate, number of infected cases,transmission laws, and development trend. Eight articles used AI to explorepotential effective drugs, primarily through drug repurposing and drugdevelopment. Finally, 1 article predicted vaccine targets that have the potentialto develop COVID-19 vaccines. Conclusions: In this review, we have shown that AI achieved high performance in diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, epidemic predictionand drug discovery for COVID-19. AI has the potential to enhance significantlyexisting medical and healthcare system efficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Since November 2019 the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused nearly 200 millioninfection and more than 4 million deaths globally (Updated information from theWorld Health Organization, as on 2(nd) Aug 2021). Within only one year into thepandemic, several vaccines were designed and reached approval for theimmunization of the world population. The remarkable protective effects of themanufactured vaccines are demonstrated in countries with high vaccination rates, such as Israel and UK. However, limited production capacities, poor distribution infrastructures and political hesitations still hamper the availability ofvaccines in many countries. In addition, due to the emergency of SARS-CoV-2variants with immune escape properties towards the vaccines the global numbers ofnew infections as well as patients developing severe COVID-19, remains high. New studies reported that about 8% of infected individuals develop long term symptomswith strong personal restrictions on private as well as professional level, whichcontributes to the long socioeconomic problems caused by this pandemic. Untiltoday, emergency use-approved treatment options for COVID-19 are limited to theantiviral Remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue targeting the viral polymerase, theglucocorticosteroide Dexamethasone as well as neutralizing antibodies. Thetherapeutic benefits of these treatments are under ongoing debate and clinicalstudies assessing the efficiency of these treatments are still underway. Toidentify new therapeutic treatments for COVID-19, now and by the post-pandemicera, diverse experimental approaches are under scientific evaluation in companiesand scientific research teams all over the world. To accelerate clinicaltranslation of promising candidates, repurposing approaches of known approveddrugs are specifically fostered but also novel technologies are being developedand are under investigation. This review summarizes the recent developments from the lab bench as well as the clinical status of emerging therapeutic candidatesand discusses possible therapeutic entry points for the treatment strategies withregard to the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical course of COVID-19.

AB  - The antimicrobial medication malarone (atovaquone/proguanil) is used as afixed-dose combination for treating children and adults with uncomplicatedmalaria or as chemoprophylaxis for preventing malaria in travelers. It is aninexpensive, efficacious, and safe drug frequently prescribed around the world.Following anecdotal evidence from 17 patients in the provinces of Quebec andOntario, Canada, suggesting that malarone/atovaquone may present some benefits inprotecting against COVID-19, we sought to examine its antiviral potential inlimiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cellular models of infection. In VeroE6expressing human TMPRSS2 and human lung Calu-3 epithelial cells, we show that theactive compound atovaquone at micromolar concentrations potently inhibits thereplication of SARS-CoV-2 and other variants of concern including the alpha,beta, and delta variants. Importantly, atovaquone retained its full antiviralactivity in a primary human airway epithelium cell culture model.Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the atovaquone antiviral activity againstSARS-CoV-2 is partially dependent on the expression of TMPRSS2 and that the drug can disrupt the interaction of the spike protein with the viral receptor, ACE2.Additionally, spike-mediated membrane fusion was also reduced in the presence of atovaquone. In the United States, two clinical trials of atovaquone administered alone or in combination with azithromycin were initiated in 2020. While we await the results of these trials, our findings in cellular infection modelsdemonstrate that atovaquone is a potent antiviral FDA-approved drug againstSARS-CoV-2 and other variants of concern in vitro.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory SyndromeCoronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses an unprecedented challenge to humanity.SARS-CoV-2 infections range from asymptomatic to severe courses of COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan involvement and death.Risk factors for disease severity include older age, male sex, increased BMI and pre-existing comorbidities. Ethnicity is also relevant to COVID-19 susceptibilityand severity. Host genetic predisposition to COVID-19 is now increasinglyrecognized and whole genome and candidate gene association studies regardingCOVID-19 susceptibility have been performed. Several common and rare variants in genes related to inflammation or immune responses have been identified. Wesummarize research on COVID-19 host genetics and compile genetic variantsassociated with susceptibility to COVID-19 and disease severity. We discusscandidate genes that should be investigated further to understand suchassociations and provide insights relevant to pathogenesis, risk classification, therapy response, precision medicine, and drug repurposing.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, a recently emerged zoonotic virus, has resulted in unstoppable highmorbidity and mortality rates worldwide. However, due to a limited knowledge ofthe dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, it has been observed that the currentCOVID-19 therapy has led to some clinical repercussions. We discuss the adverseeffects of drugs for COVID-19 primarily based on some clinical trials. Astherapeutic efficacy and toxicity of therapy may vary due to different, geneticdeterminants, sex, age and the ethnic background of test subjects, hencebiomarker-based personalized therapy could be more appropriate. We will share ourthoughts on the current landscape of personalized therapy as a roadmap to fightagainst SARS-CoV-2 or another emerging pathogen.

AB  - The currently circulating novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) hasbrought the whole world to a standstill. Recent studies have deciphered the viralgenome structure, epidemiology and are in the process of unveiling multiplemechanisms of pathogenesis. Apart from atypical pneumonia and lung diseasemanifestations, this disease has also been found to be associated withneurological symptoms, which include dizziness, headache, stroke, or seizures,among others. However, a possible direct or indirect association betweenSARS-CoV-2 and seizures is still not clear. In any manner, it may be of interest to analyze the drugs being used for viral infection in the background of epilepsyor vice versa. To identify the most credible drug candidate for COVID-19 inpersons with epilepsy or COVID-19 patients experiencing seizures. A literaturesearch for original and review articles was performed, and further, theComparative Toxicogenomics Database was used to unearth the most credible drugcandidate. Our search based on common mechanistic targets affecting SARS-CoV-2and seizures revealed ivermectin, dexamethasone, anakinra, and tocilizumab forprotection against both COVID-19 and seizures. Amongst the antiseizuremedications, we found valproic acid as the most probable pharmacotherapy forCOVID-19 patients experiencing seizures. These findings would hopefully providethe basis for initiating further studies on the pathogenesis and drug targetingstrategies for this emerging infection accompanied with seizures or in peoplewith epilepsy.

AB  - The coronavirus disease emerged in December 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SevereAcute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Its rapid globalspread has brought an international health emergency and urgent responses forseeking efficient prevention and therapeutic treatment. This has led toimperative needs for illustration of the molecular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2,identification of molecular targets or receptors, and development of antiviraldrugs, antibodies, and vaccines. In this study, we investigated the currentresearch progress in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the publishedresearch findings, we first elucidated, at the molecular level, SARS-CoV-2 viral structures, potential viral host-cell-invasion, pathogenic mechanisms, mainvirus-induced immune responses, and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. We then focusedon the main virus- and host-based potential targets and summarized andcategorized effective inhibitory molecules based on drug development strategiesfor COVID-19 that can guide efforts for the identification of new drugs andtreatment for this problematic disease. Current research and development ofantibodies and vaccines were also introduced and discussed. We concluded that themain virus entry route- SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interaction with ACE2 receptors played a key role in guiding the development of therapeutic treatments againstCOVID-19. Four main strategies may be considered in developing moleculartherapeutics, and drug repurposing is likely to be an easy, fast and low-costapproach in such a short period of time with urgent need of antiviral drugs.Additionally, the quick development of antibody and vaccine candidates hasyielded promising results, but the wide-scale deployment of safe and effectiveCOVID-19 vaccines remains paramount in solving the pandemic crisis. As newvariants of the virus emerge, the efficacy of these vaccines and treatments must be closely evaluated. Finally, we discussed the possible challenges of developingmolecular therapeutics for COVID-19 and suggested some potential future efforts. Despite the limited availability of literature, our attempt in this work toprovide a relatively comprehensive overview of current SARS-CoV-2 studies can be helpful for quickly acquiring the key information of COVID-19 and furtherpromoting this important research to control and diminish the pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Considering the disruptions imposed by lockdowns and socialdistancing recommendations, coupled with overwhelmed healthcare systems,researchers worldwide have been exploring drug repositioning strategies fortreating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). OBJECTIVE:To compile results from randomized clinical trials on the effect ofdexamethasone, compared with standard treatment for management of SARS-CoV-2.DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis inaccordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews andMeta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in a Brazilian public university. METHODS: Wesought to compile data from 6724 hospitalized patients with confirmed orsuspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Treatment with dexamethasonesignificantly reduced mortality within 28 days (risk ratio, RR: 0.89; 95%confidence interval, CI: 0.82-0.97). Dexamethasone use was linked with beingdischarged alive within 28 days (odds ratio, OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.07-1.33).CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that dexamethasone may significantly improve theoutcome among hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and associatedsevere respiratory complications. -Further studies need to consider bothdose-dependent administration and outcomes in early and later stages of thedisease.

AB  - Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) studies were performed on four benzimidazoles (compounds 1-4) and twobenzothiazoles (compounds 5 and 6), previously synthesized by our group. Thecompounds were also investigated for their binding affinity and interactions withthe SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) (PDB ID: 6LU7) and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (PDB ID: 6 M18) using a molecular docking approach. Compounds1, 2, and 3 were found to bind with equal affinity to both targets. Compound 1showed the highest predictive docking scores, and was further subjected tomolecular dynamics (MD) simulation to explain protein stability, ligandproperties, and protein-ligand interactions. All compounds were assessed fortheir structural, physico-chemical, pharmacokinetic, and toxicologicalproperties. Our results suggest that the investigated compounds are potential newdrug leads to target SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak prompts an urgent need for efficient therapeutics,and repurposing of known drugs has been extensively used in an attempt to get to anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents in the shortest possible time. The glycoside rutin showsmanifold pharmacological activities and, despite its use being limited by itspoor solubility in water, it is the active principle of many pharmaceuticalpreparations. We herein report our in silico and experimental investigations ofrutin as a SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor and of its water solubility improvementobtained by mixing it with l-arginine. Tests of the rutin/l-arginine mixture in acellular model of SARS-CoV-2 infection highlighted that the mixture still suffersfrom unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties, but nonetheless, the results of thisstudy suggest that rutin might be a good starting point for hit optimization.

TI  - Tomatidine and Patchouli Alcohol as Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Enzymes (3CLpro,PLpro and NSP15) by Molecular Docking and Molecular Dynamics Simulations.
LID - 10693 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms221910693 [doi]
AB  - Considering the current dramatic and fatal situation due to the high spreading ofSARS-CoV-2 infection, there is an urgent unmet medical need to identify novel andeffective approaches for prevention and treatment of Coronavirus disease (COVID19) by re-evaluating and repurposing of known drugs. For this, tomatidine andpatchouli alcohol have been selected as potential drugs for combating the virus. The hit compounds were subsequently docked into the active site and moleculardocking analyses revealed that both drugs can bind the active site of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, PLpro, NSP15, COX-2 and PLA2 targets with a number of important bindinginteractions. To further validate the interactions of promising compoundtomatidine, Molecular dynamics study of 100 ns was carried out towards 3CLpro,NSP15 and COX-2. This indicated that the protein-ligand complex was stablethroughout the simulation period, and minimal backbone fluctuations have ensuedin the system. Post dynamic MM-GBSA analysis of molecular dynamics data showedpromising mean binding free energy 47.4633 +/- 9.28, 51.8064 +/- 8.91 and 54.8918+/- 7.55 kcal/mol, respectively. Likewise, in silico ADMET studies of theselected ligands showed excellent pharmacokinetic properties with goodabsorption, bioavailability and devoid of toxicity. Therefore, patchouli alcohol and especially, tomatidine may provide prospect treatment options againstSARS-CoV-2 infection by potentially inhibiting virus duplication though moreresearch is guaranteed and secured.

AB  - Blocking the main replicating enzyme, 3 Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL(pro)) is the most promising drug development strategy against the SARS-CoV-2 virus,responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. In the present work, 9101 drugsobtained from the drug bank database were screened against SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro)prosing deep learning, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulationtechniques. In the initial stage, 500 drug-screened by deep learning regressionmodel and subjected to molecular docking that resulted in 10 screened compoundswith strong binding affinity. Further, five compounds were checked for theirbinding potential by analyzing molecular dynamics simulation for 100 ns at 300 K.In the final stage, two compounds{4-[(2s,4e)-2-(1,3-Benzothiazol-2-Yl)-2-(1h-1,2,3-Benzotriazol-1-Yl)-5-Phenylpent-4-Enyl]Phenyl}(Difluoro)Methylphosphonic Acid and1-(3-(2,4-dimethylthiazol-5-yl)-4-oxo-2,4-dihydroindeno[1,2-c]pyrazol-5-yl)-3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)urea were screened as potential hits by analyzing severalparameters like RMSD, Rg, RMSF, MMPBSA, and SASA. Thus, our study suggests twopotential drugs that can be tested in the experimental conditions to evaluate theefficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Further, such drugs could be modified to developmore potent drugs against COVID-19.

AB  - Respiratory viruses continue to afflict mankind. Among them, pathogens such ascoronaviruses [including the current pandemic agent known as severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] and the one causing influenza A (IAV) are highly contagious and deadly. These can evade the immune systemdefenses while causing a hyperinflammatory response that can damage differenttissues/organs. Simultaneously targeting several immunomodulatory proteins is aplausible antiviral strategy since it could lead to the discovery ofindirect-acting pan-antiviral (IAPA) agents for the treatment of diseases caused by respiratory viruses. In this context, computational approaches, which are anessential part of the modern drug discovery campaigns, could accelerate theidentification of multi-target immunomodulators. This perspective discusses theusefulness of computational multi-target drug discovery for the virtual screening(drug repurposing) of IAPA agents capable of boosting the immune system throughthe activation of the toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and/or the stimulator ofinterferon genes (STING) while inhibiting key inflammation-related proteins such as caspase-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).

AB  - The alarming pandemic situation of Coronavirus infectious disease COVID-19,caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), hasbecome a critical threat to public health. The unexpected outbreak andunrealistic progression of COVID-19 have generated an utmost need to realizepromising therapeutic strategies to fight the pandemic. Drug repurposing-anefficient drug discovery technique from approved drugs is an emerging tactic toface the immediate global challenge. It offers a time-efficient andcost-effective way to find potential therapeutic agents for the disease.Artificial Intelligence-empowered deep learning models enable the rapididentification of potentially repurposable drug candidates against diseases. Thisstudy presents a deep learning ensemble model to prioritize clinically validated anti-viral drugs for their potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. The methodintegrates the similarities of drug chemical structures and virus genomesequences to generate feature vectors. The best combination of features isretrieved by the convolutional neural network in a deep learning manner. Theextracted deep features are classified by the extreme gradient boostingclassifier to infer potential virus-drug associations. The method could achievean AUC of 0.8897 with 0.8571 prediction accuracy and 0.8394 sensitivity under thefivefold cross-validation. The experimental results and case studies demonstrate the suggested deep learning ensemble system yields competitive results comparedwith the state-of-the-art approaches. The top-ranked drugs are released forfurther wet-lab researches.

AB  - The highly infectious disease COVID-19 is induced by SARS-coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2), which has spread rapidly around the globe and was announced as apandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 bindsto the host cell's angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor through theviral surface spike glycoprotein (S-protein). ACE2 is expressed in the oralmucosa and can therefore constitute an essential route for entry of SARS-CoV-2into hosts through the tongue and lung epithelial cells. At present, no effectivetreatments for SARS-CoV-2 are yet in place. Blocking entry of the virus byinhibiting ACE2 is more advantageous than inhibiting the subsequent stages of theSARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Based on current published evidence, we have summarizedthe different in silico based studies and repurposing of anti-viral drugs totarget ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein: ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD: ACE2. This reviewwill be useful to researchers looking to effectively recognize and deal withSARS-CoV-2, and in the development of repurposed ACE2 inhibitors againstCOVID-19.

AB  - Endemic seasonal coronaviruses cause morbidity and mortality in a subset ofpatients, but no specific treatment is available. Molnupiravir is a promisingpipeline antiviral drug for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection potentially bytargeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). This study aims to evaluate thepotential of repurposing molnupiravir for treating seasonal human coronavirus(HCoV) infections. Molecular docking revealed that the active form ofmolnupiravir, beta-D-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (NHC), has similar binding affinity to RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E. In cellculture models, treatment of molnupiravir effectively inhibited viral replicationand production of infectious viruses of the three seasonal coronaviruses. Atime-of-drug-addition experiment indicates the specificity of molnupiravir ininhibiting viral components. Furthermore, combining molnupiravir with theprotease inhibitor GC376 resulted in enhanced antiviral activity. Our findingshighlight that the great potential of repurposing molnupiravir for treatingseasonal coronavirus infected patients.

AB  - Computational drug repositioning aims at ranking and selecting existing drugs fornovel diseases or novel use in old diseases. In silico drug screening has thepotential for speeding up considerably the shortlisting of promising candidatesin response to outbreaks of diseases such as COVID-19 for which no satisfactorycure has yet been found. We describe DrugMerge as a methodology for preclinicalcomputational drug repositioning based on merging multiple drug rankings obtainedwith an ensemble of disease active subnetworks. DrugMerge uses differentialtranscriptomic data on drugs and diseases in the context of a large geneco-expression network. Experiments with four benchmark diseases demonstrate that our method detects in first position drugs in clinical use for the specifieddisease, in all four cases. Application of DrugMerge to COVID-19 found rankingswith many drugs currently in clinical trials for COVID-19 in top positions, thus showing that DrugMerge can mimic human expert judgment.

TI  - Vitamin D supplementation and COVID-19: expert consensus and guidelines.
LID - 10.1684/pnv.2021.0955 [doi]
AB  - After 12 months of viral circulation, the SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions ofpeople around the world, leaving hundreds of thousands dead. Given the lack ofeffective therapy and vaccination against COVID-19, focusing on the immediaterepurposing of existing drugs gives some hope of curbing the pandemic. Vitamin D is a possible candidate drug which is discussed in a high number of publications.Randomised clinical trials have shown that vitamin D supplementationsignificantly reduces the risk of respiratory infections. There is also a greatdeal of evidence that hypovitaminosis D is an independent (and easily modifiable)risk factor for severe forms of COVID-19 and death. Vitamin D supplementation is a simple, safe and inexpensive measure, which is effective in correctinghypovitaminosis D, present in 40-50% of the French population and in more than80% of adults with COVID-19. In this position paper, we propose simple regimens(adapted to the pharmaceutical forms currently available in France) for vitamin Dsupplementation in adults with or without COVID-19.

AB  - The recent outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the novel pathogen SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a severe health emergency. In this pandemic, drug repurposingseems to be the most promising alternative to identify effective therapeuticagents for immediate treatment of infected patients. The present study aimed toevaluate all the drugs present in drug bank as potential novel SARS-CoV-2inhibitors, using computational drug repurposing studies. Docking-based virtualscreening and binding energy prediction were performed, followed by AbsorptionDistribution Metabolism Excretion calculation. Hydroxychloroquine and Nelfinavir have been identified as the best potential inhibitor against the SARS-CoV-2,therefore, they were used as reference compounds in computational DR studies. Thedocking study revealed 13 best compounds based on their highest binding affinity,binding energy, and dock score concerning the other screened compounds. Out of13, only 4 compounds were further shortlisted based on their binding energy andbest ADME properties. The hierarchical virtual screening yielded the best 04drugs, DB07042 (compound 2), DB13035 (compound 3), DB13604 (compound 5) andDB08253 (compound 6), with commendable binding energies in kcal/mol, i.e. -65.45,-62.01, -52.09 and -51.70 respectively. Further, Molecular dynamics simulationwith 04 best-retrieved hits has confirmed stable trajectories in protein in termsof root mean square deviation and root mean square fluctuation. During 30 nssimulation, the interactions were also found similar to the docking-basedstudies. However, clinical studies are necessary to investigate their therapeuticuse against this outbreak.

AB  - COVID-19 is a pandemic initially identified in Wuhan, China, which is caused by anovel coronavirus, also recognized as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome(SARS-nCoV-2). Unlike other coronaviruses, this novel pathogen may cause unusual contagious pain which results in viral pneumonia, serious heart problems, andeven death. Researchers worldwide are continuously striving to develop a cure forthis highly infective disease, yet there are no well-defined absolute treatments available at present. Several vaccination drives with emergency use authorisationvaccines are being done across many countries, however, their long term efficacy and side-effects study are yet to be done. The research community is analysingthe situation by collecting the datasets from various sources. Healthcareprofessionals must thoroughly analyse the situation, devise preventive measuresfor this pandemic, and even develop possible drug combinations. Variousanalytical and statistical models have been developed, however, their outcomerate is prolonged. Thus, modern science stresses on the application ofstate-of-the-art methods in this combat against COVID-19. The application ofArtificial intelligence (AI), and AI-driven tools are emerging as effectivetools, especially with X-Ray and CT-Scan imaging data of infected subjects,infection trend predictions etc. The high efficacy of these AI systems can beobserved in terms of highly accurate results, i.e. >95%, as reported in variousstudies. AI-driven tools are being used in COVID diagnostic, therapeutics, trend prediction, drug design and prevention to help fight against this pandemic. This paper aims to provide a deep insight into the comprehensive literature about AIand AI-driven tools in this battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. The extensiveliterature is divided into five sections, each describing the application of AIagainst COVID-19 viz. COVID-19 Prevention, diagnostic, infection spread trendprediction, therapeutic and drug repurposing.

TI  - Targeting cathepsins: A potential link between COVID-19 and associatedneurological manifestations.
PG  - e08089
LID - 10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08089 [doi]
AB  - Many studies have shown that the lysosomal cathepsins, especially cathepsins B/L (CTSB/L) are required for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. Lysosomal proteases, cathepsins are indispensable for normal health and are involved in several brain disorders occurring at different development age periods. On the other hand, ithas been well known that COVID-19 infection is largely associated with severalneurological disorders. Taken together these findings and given the high levelsof expression of CTSB/L in the brain, we here proposed a reasonable hypothesisabout the involvement of CTSB/L in the neurological manifestations linked toCOVID-19. Pharmacological inhibitions of the CTSB/L could be a potentialtherapeutic target to block the virus entry as well as to mitigate the braindisorders. To this end, we utilized the network-based drug repurposing analysesto identify the possible drugs that can target CTSB/L. This study identifies the molecules like cyclosporine, phenytoin, and paclitaxel as potential drugs withbinding ability to the CTSB/L. Further, we have performed molecular docking andall-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the stability ofCTSL-drug complexes. The results showed strong and stable binding of drugs withCTSL.

AB  - A novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome is rapidlyspreading worldwide. The international health authorities are putting all theirefforts on quick diagnosis and placing the patients in quarantine. Althoughdifferent vaccines have come for quick use as prophylactics, drug repurposingseems to be of paramount importance because of inefficient therapeutic optionsand clinical trial limitations. Here, we used structure-based drug designingapproach to find and check the efficacy of the possible drug that can inhibitcoronavirus main protease which is involved in polypeptide processing tofunctional protein. We performed virtual screening, molecular docking andmolecular dynamics simulations of the FDA-approved drugs against the mainprotease of SARS-CoV-2. Using well-defined computational methods, we identifiedamprenavir, cefoperazone, riboflavin, diosmin, nadide and troxerutin approved forhuman therapeutic uses, as COVID-19 main protease inhibitors. These drugs bind tothe SARS-CoV-2 main protease conserved residues of substrate-binding pocket andformed a remarkable number of non-covalent interactions. We have found diosmin asan inhibitor which binds covalently to the COVID-19 main protease. This studyprovides enough evidences for therapeutic use of these drugs in controllingCOVID-19 after experimental validation and clinical demonstration.

AB  - Effective therapies for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are urgently needed. Maladaptive hyperinflammation and excessive cytokine release underlie the diseaseseverity, with antiinflammatory and cytokine inhibiting agents expected to exert therapeutic effects. A major present challenge is identification of appropriatephase of the illness for a given intervention to yield optimum outcomes.Considering its established disease biomarker and drug discovery potential, acompendious analysis of existing transcriptomic data is presented here towardaddressing this gap. The analysis is based on COVID-19 data related to intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU admissions, discharged and deceased patients,ventilation and non-ventilation phases, and high oxygen supplementation. Itintegrates transcriptomic data related to the effects of, in various cellulartreatment models, the COVID-19 randomized clinical trial (RCT) successful drugdexamethasone, and the failed drug, with a potential to harm,hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine. Similarly, effects of various COVID-19 candidate drugs/anticytokines as well as proinflammatory cytokines implicated in theillness are also examined. The underlying assumption was that compared toCOVID-19, an effective drug/anticytokine and a disease aggravating agent wouldaffect gene regulation in opposite and same direction, in that order. Remarkably,the assumption was supported with respect to both the RCT drugs. With thiscontrol validation, etanercept, followed by tofacitinib and adalimumab, showedtranscriptomic effects predictive of benefits in both ventilation andnon-ventilation ICU stages as well as in non-ICU phase. On the other hand,canakinumab showed potential for effectiveness in high oxygen supplementationphase. These findings may inform experimental and clinical studies toward drugrepurposing in COVID-19.

AB  - The pandemic infectious disease (Covid-19) caused by the coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) is spreading rapidly around the world. Covid-19 does an irreparable harm to thehealth and life of people. It also has a negative financial impact on theeconomies of most countries of the world. In this regard, the issue of creatingdrugs aimed at combating this disease is especially acute. In this work,molecular docking was used to study the docking of 23 compounds with QRF3aSARS-CoV2. The performed in silico modeling made it possible to identify leading compounds capable of exerting a potential inhibitory and virucidal effect. Theleading compounds include chlorin (a drug used in PDT), iron(III)protoporphyrin(endogenous porphyrin), and tetraanthraquinone porphyrazine (an exogenoussubstance). Having taken into consideration the localization of ligands in theQRF3a SARS-CoV2, we have made an assumption about their influence on thepathogenesis of Covid-19. The interaction of chlorin, iron(III)protoporphyrin andprotoporphyrin with the viral protein ORF3a were studied by fluorescence andUV-Vis spectroscopy. The obtained experimental results confirm the data ofmolecular docking. The results showed that a viral protein binds to endogenousporphyrins and chlorins, moreover, chlorin is a competitive ligand for endogenousporphyrins. Chlorin should be considered as a promising drug for repurposing.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic poses a huge problem of public health that requires theimplementation of all available means to contrast it, and drugs are one of them. In this context, we observed an unmet need of depicting the continuously evolvingscenario of the ongoing drug clinical trials through an easy-to-use, freelyaccessible online tool. Starting from this consideration, we developedCOVIDrugNet ( http://compmedchem.unibo.it/covidrugnet ), a web application thatallows users to capture a holistic view and keep up to date on how the clinicaldrug research is responding to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we describe theweb app and show through some examples how one can explore the whole landscape ofmedicines in clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19 and try to probe theconsistency of the current approaches with the available biological andpharmacological evidence. We conclude that careful analyses of the COVID-19drug-target system based on COVIDrugNet can help to understand the biologicalimplications of the proposed drug options, and eventually improve the search for more effective therapies.

TI  - Repurposing fusion inhibitor peptide against SARS-CoV-2.
PG  - 2283-2293
LID - 10.1002/jcc.26758 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is continuouslyevolving. Although several vaccines were approved, this pandemic is still a majorthreat to public life. Till date, no established therapies are available against SARS-CoV-2. Peptide inhibitors hold great promise for this viral pathogen due to their efficacy, safety, and specificity. In this study, seventeen antiviralpeptides which were known to inhibit SARS-CoV-1 are collected and computationallyscreened against heptad repeat 1 (HR1) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S2). Out of 17 peptides, Fp13 and Fp14 showed better binding affinity toward HR1 compared to a control peptide EK1 (a modified pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor) inmolecular docking. To explore the time-dependent interactions of the fusionpeptide with HR1, molecular dynamics simulation was performed incorporating lipidmembrane. During 100 ns MD simulation, structural and energy parameters ofFp13-HR1 and Fp14-HR1 complexes demonstrated lower fluctuations compared to thecontrol EK1-HR1 complex. Furthermore, principal component analysis and freeenergy landscape study revealed that these two peptides (Fp13 and Fp14) strongly bind to the HR1 with higher affinity than that of control EK1. Tyr917, Asn919,Gln926, lys933, and Gln949 residues in HR1 protein were found to be crucialresidues for peptide interaction. Notably, Fp13, Fp14 showed reasonably betterbinding free energy and hydrogen bond contribution than that of EK1. Takentogether, Fp13 and Fp14 peptides may be highly specific for HR1 which canpotentially prevent the formation of the fusion core and could be furtherdeveloped as therapeutics for treatment or prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Papain-like protease (nsp-3; non-structural protein) of novel corona virus is an ideal target for developing drugs as it plays multiple important functions forviral growth and replication. For instance, role of nsp-3 has been recognized in cleavage of viral polyprotein; furthermore, in infected host it weakens theimmune system via downregulating the production of type I interferon. Thisdownregulation is promoted by removal of ubiquitin-like interferon-stimulatedgene 15 protein (ISG15) from interferon-responsive factor 3 (IRF3) protein. Amongknown inhibitors of SARS-CoV-PLpro GRL0617 is by far the most effectiveinhibitor. As PLpro of SARS-CoV2 is having more than 80% similarity withSARS-CoV-PLpro, GRL0617 is reported to be effective even against SARS-CoV2. Owingto this similarity, certain key amino acids remain the same/conserved in bothproteins. Among conserved amino acids Tyr268 for SARS-CoV2 and Tyr269 forSARS-CoV produce important hydrophobic interactions with aromatic rings ofGRL0617. Here, in this study antibacterial compounds were collected from ZINCdatabase, and they were filtered to select compounds that are having similarstructural features as GRL0617. This filtered library of compound was then dockedwith SARS-CoV and CoV2-PLpro. Five hits were noted that were able to interactwith Tyr268 (SARS-CoV2) and Tyr269 (SARS-CoV). Further, best hit2-(2-((benzofuran-2-carboxamido)methyl)-5-methoxy-1H-indol-1-yl)acetic acid(ZINC44459905) was studied using molecular dynamic simulation where stability of protein-ligand complex as well as stability of produced interactions was noted.

AB  - As the COVID-19 pandemic grows, several therapeutic candidates are being testedor undergoing clinical trials. Although prophylactic vaccination againstSARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to be effective, no definitive treatmentexists to date in the event of infection. The rapid spread of infection bySARS-CoV-2 and its variants fully warrants the continued evaluation of drugtreatments for COVID-19, especially in the context of repurposing of alreadyavailable and safe drugs. Here, we explored the therapeutic potential ofmelatonin and melatonergic compounds in attenuating COVID-19 pathogenesis in miceexpressing human ACE2 receptor (K18-hACE2), strongly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2infection. Daily administration of melatonin, agomelatine, or ramelteon delaysthe occurrence of severe clinical outcome with improvement of survival,especially with high melatonin dose. Although no changes in most lunginflammatory cytokines are observed, treatment with melatonergic compounds limitsthe exacerbated local lung production of type I and type III interferons, whichis likely associated with the observed improved symptoms in treated mice. Thepromising results from this preclinical study should encourage studies examining the benefits of repurposing melatonergic drugs to treat COVID-19 and relateddiseases in humans.

AB  - We report here the synthesis, purification, and characterization of mono- anddi-fatty acyl conjugates of remdesivir (RDV) and their in vitro antiviralactivity against SAR-CoV-2, an Ebola virus transcription- andreplication-competent virus-like particle (trVLP) system, and infectious Ebolavirus. The most potent monofatty acyl conjugate was 4b, containing a4-oxatetradecanolyl at the 3' position. Monofatty acyl conjugates,3'-O-tetradecanoyl (4a) (IC50(VeroE6) = 2.3 muM; IC50(Calu3) = 0.24 muM),3'-O-4-oxatetradodecanoyl (4b) (IC50(VeroE6) = 2.0 muM; IC50(Calu3) = 0.18 muM), and 3'-O-(12-ethylthiododecanoyl) (4e) (IC50(VeroE6) = 2.4 muM; IC50(Calu3) =0.25 muM) derivatives exhibited less activity than RDV (IC50(VeroE6) = 0.85 muM; IC50(Calu3) = 0.06 muM) in both VeroE6 and Calu3 cells. Difatty acylation led to a significant reduction in the antiviral activity of RDV (as shown in conjugates 5a and 5b) against SARS-CoV-2 when compared with monofatty acylation (3a-e and4a-e). About 77.9% of 4c remained intact after 4 h incubation with human plasmawhile only 47% of parent RDV was observed at the 2 h time point. The resultsclearly indicate the effectiveness of fatty acylation to improve the half-life ofRDV. The antiviral activities of a number of monofatty acyl conjugates of RDV,such as 3b, 3e, and 4b, were comparable with RDV against the Ebola trVLP system. Meanwhile, the corresponding physical mixtures of RDV and fatty acids 6a and 6bshowed 1.6 to 2.2 times less antiviral activity than the correspondingconjugates, 4a and 4c, respectively, against SARS-CoV-2 in VeroE6 cells. Asignificant reduction in viral RNA synthesis was observed for selected compounds 3a and 4b consistent with the IC50 results. These studies indicate the potential of these compounds as long-acting antiviral agents or prodrugs of RDV.

COIS- Declaration of competing interest The increasing prevalence of COVID-19 is asevere public health problem affecting people globally. COVID-19 is taking adevastating toll on human lives. Several existing drugs and potential drugcandidates such as remdesivir (RDV) have been considered for repurposing asCOVID-19 treatments. Our group has previously studied the impact of fattyacylation on the antiviral activity of different anti-HIV (human immunodeficiencyvirus) nucleoside drugs. The conjugates were more potent and less toxic thantheir parent nucleoside analogs, providing a much higher selectivity index.Furthermore, the conjugates significantly enhanced the cellular uptake versus theparent analogs and corresponding physical mixtures of fatty acids andnucleosides. Herein, we report the synthesis of fatty acyl derivatives of RDV andstructural characterization of their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 inVeroE6 cells and Calu3 cells. Five fatty acids, myristic acid, 12-azidododecanoicacid, 12-thioethyldodecanoic acid, 4-oxatetradecanoic acid, and palmitic acidwere conjugated to RDV at its 2'-O- and 3'-O-position. Most monofatty acylderivatives of RDV demonstrated IC(50) values against SARS-CoV-2 that were onlyslightly decreased relative to RDV. Against the EBOV trVLP and infectious EBOV,any of the monofatty acyl conjugates had IC(50)s similar to that of RDV. Overall,these data together indicate that RDV can be modified with fatty acids atpositions 2' or 3', without demonstrating a significant loss of antiviralactivity in cell culture against SARS-CoV-2 and EBOV. Future studies willdetermine if these modifications result in greater long-acting effect,bioavailability, and stability in animal models.

AB  - Drug repurposing has the potential to bring existing de-risked drugs foreffective intervention in an ongoing pandemic-COVID-19 that has infected over 131million, with 2.8 million people succumbing to the illness globally (as of April 04, 2021). We have used a novel `gene signature'-based drug repositioningstrategy by applying widely accepted gene ranking algorithms to prioritize theFDA approved or under trial drugs. We mined publically available RNA sequencing(RNA-Seq) data using CLC Genomics Workbench 20 (QIAGEN) and identified 283differentially expressed genes (FDR<0.05, log2FC>1) after a meta-analysis ofthree independent studies which were based on severe acute respiratorysyndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in primary human airwayepithelial cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that SARS-CoV-2activated key canonical pathways and gene networks that intricately regulategeneral anti-viral as well as specific inflammatory pathways. Drug database,extracted from the Metacore and IPA, identified 15 drug targets (with informationon COVID-19 pathogenesis) with 46 existing drugs as potential-novel candidatesfor repurposing for COVID-19 treatment. We found 35 novel drugs that inhibittargets (ALPL, CXCL8, and IL6) already in clinical trials for COVID-19. Also, we found 6 existing drugs against 4 potential anti-COVID-19 targets (CCL20, CSF3,CXCL1, CXCL10) that might have novel anti-COVID-19 indications. Finally, thesedrug targets were computationally prioritized based on gene ranking algorithms,which revealed CXCL10 as the common and strongest candidate with 2 existingdrugs. Furthermore, the list of 283 SARS-CoV-2-associated proteins could bevaluable not only as anti-COVID-19 targets but also useful for COVID-19 biomarkerdevelopment.

AB  - Caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19 is a virus-induced inflammatory disease of the airways and lungs that leads tosevere multi-organ damage and death. Here we show that cellular lipid synthesisis required for SARS-CoV-2 replication and offers an opportunity forpharmacological intervention. Screening a short-hairpin RNA sublibrary thattargets metabolic genes, we identified genes that either inhibit or promoteSARS-CoV-2 viral infection, including two key candidate genes, ACACA and FASN,which operate in the same lipid synthesis pathway. We further screened andidentified several potent inhibitors of fatty acid synthase (encoded by FASN),including the US Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-obesity drugorlistat, and found that it inhibits in vitro replication of SARS-CoV-2 variants,including more contagious new variants, such as Delta. In a mouse model ofSARS-CoV-2 infection (K18-hACE2 transgenic mice), injections of orlistat resultedin lower SARS-CoV-2 viral levels in the lung, reduced lung pathology andincreased mouse survival. Our findings identify fatty acid synthase inhibitors asdrug candidates for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 by inhibitingSARS-CoV-2 replication. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy ofrepurposing fatty acid synthase inhibitors for severe COVID-19 in humans.

AB  - Our therapeutic arsenal against viruses is very limited and the current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 highlights the critical need for effective antivirals againstemerging coronaviruses. Cellular assays allowing a precise quantification ofviral replication in high-throughput experimental settings are essential to thescreening of chemical libraries and the selection of best antiviral chemicalstructures. To develop a reporting system for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we generated cell lines expressing a firefly luciferase maintained in an inactive form by aconsensus cleavage site for the viral protease 3CL(Pro) of coronaviruses, so thatthe luminescent biosensor is turned on upon 3CL(Pro) expression or SARS-CoV-2infection. This cellular assay was used to screen a metabolism-oriented libraryof 492 compounds to identify metabolic vulnerabilities of coronaviruses fordeveloping innovative therapeutic strategies. In agreement with recent reports,inhibitors of pyrimidine biosynthesis were found to prevent SARS-CoV-2replication. Among the top hits, we also identified the NADPH oxidase (NOX)inhibitor Setanaxib. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of Setanaxib was furtherconfirmed using ACE2-expressing human pulmonary cells Beas2B as well as humanprimary nasal epithelial cells. Altogether, these results validate our cell-basedfunctional assay and the interest of screening libraries of different origins to identify inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 for drug repurposing or development.

LID - 10.3390/pathogens10091076 [doi]
AB  - Currently, human infections with the severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are accelerating the ongoing spread of thepandemic. Several innovative types of vaccines have already been developed,whereas effective options of antiviral treatments still await a scientificimplementation. The development of novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates demands skillful strategies and analysis systems. Promising results have been achievedwith first generation direct-acting antivirals targeting the viral polymeraseRdRp or the protease 3CL(pro). Such recently approved or investigational drugslike remdesivir and GC376 represent a basis for further development andoptimization. Here, we establish a multi-readout assay (MRA) system that enables the antiviral assessment and mechanistic characterization of novel testcompounds, drug repurposing and combination treatments. Our SARS-CoV-2-specificMRA combines the quantitative measurement of several parameters of virusinfection, such as the intracellular production of proteins and genomes,enzymatic activities and virion release, as well as the use of reporter systems. In this regard, the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir and GC376 has beeninvestigated in human Caco-2 cells. The readouts included the use of spike- anddouble-strand RNA-specific monoclonal antibodies for in-cell fluorescenceimaging, a newly generated recombinant SARS-CoV-2 reporter virus d6YFP, the novel3CL(pro)-based FRET CFP::YFP and the previously reported FlipGFP reporter assays,as well as viral genome-specific RT-qPCR. The data produced by our MRA confirmthe high antiviral potency of these two drugs in vitro. Combined, this MRAapproach may be applied for broader analyses of SARS-CoV-2-specific antivirals,including compound screenings and the characterization of selected drugcandidates.

TI  - Repurposing Cardiac Glycosides: Drugs for Heart Failure Surmounting Viruses.
LID - 5627 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules26185627 [doi]
AB  - Drug repositioning is a successful approach in medicinal research. Itsignificantly simplifies the long-term process of clinical drug evaluation, sincethe drug being tested has already been approved for another condition. Oneexample of drug repositioning involves cardiac glycosides (CGs), which have, for a long time, been used in heart medicine. Moreover, it has been known for decadesthat CGs also have great potential in cancer treatment and, thus, many clinicaltrials now evaluate their anticancer potential. Interestingly, heart failure and cancer are not the only conditions for which CGs could be effectively used. Inrecent years, the antiviral potential of CGs has been extensively studied, andwith the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this interest in CGs has increased evenmore. Therefore, here, we present CGs as potent and promising antiviralcompounds, which can interfere with almost any steps of the viral life cycle,except for the viral attachment to a host cell. In this review article, wesummarize the reported data on this hot topic and discuss the mechanisms ofantiviral action of CGs, with reference to the particular viral life cycle phase they interfere with.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-2019 pandemic lead to a raised interest on the development ofnew treatments through Artificial Intelligence (AI). AIM: to carry out asystematic review on the development of repurposed drugs against COVID-2019through the application of AI. METHODS: The Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist was applied. KEYWORDS: ["Artificial intelligence" and (COVIDor SARS) and (medicine or drug)]. Databases: PubMed((R)), DOAJ and SciELO.Cochrane Library was additionally screened to identify previous published reviewson the same topic. RESULTS: From the 277 identified records [PubMed((R)) (n =157); DOAJ (n = 119) and SciELO (n = 1)], 27 studies were included. Among other, the selected studies on new treatments against COVID-2019 were classified, asfollows: studies with in-vitro and/or clinical data; association of known drugs; and other studies related to repurposing of drugs. CONCLUSION: Diversepotentially repurposed drugs against COVID-2019 were identified. The repurposeddrugs were mainly from antivirals, antibiotics, anticancer, anti-inflammatory,and Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) groups, although diverse otherpharmacologic groups were covered. AI was a suitable tool to quickly analyzelarge amounts of data or to estimate drug repurposing against COVID-2019.

LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics13091514 [doi]
AB  - Effective therapies for COVID-19 are still lacking, and drug repositioning is apromising approach to address this problem. Here, we adopted a medicalinformatics approach to repositioning. We leveraged a large prospective cohort,the UK-Biobank (UKBB, N ~ 397,000), and studied associations of prior use of all level-4 ATC drug categories (N = 819, including vaccines) with COVID-19 diagnosisand severity. Effects of drugs on the risk of infection, disease severity, andmortality were investigated separately. Logistic regression was conducted,controlling for main confounders. We observed strong and highly consistentprotective associations with statins. Many top-listed protective drugs were also cardiovascular medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors(ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), calcium channel blocker (CCB), andbeta-blockers. Some other drugs showing protective associations includedbiguanides (metformin), estrogens, thyroid hormones, proton pump inhibitors, and testosterone-5-alpha reductase inhibitors, among others. We also observedprotective associations by influenza, pneumococcal, and several other vaccines.Subgroup and interaction analyses were also conducted, which revealed differencesin protective effects in various subgroups. For example, protective effects offlu/pneumococcal vaccines were weaker in obese individuals, while protection bystatins was stronger in cardiovascular patients. To conclude, our analysisrevealed many drug repositioning candidates, for example several cardiovascularmedications. Further studies are required for validation.

AB  - The novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2) has caused a pandemic. There are currently several marketedvaccines and many in clinical trials targeting SARS-CoV-2. Another strategy is torepurpose approved drugs to decrease the burden of the COVID-19 (official namefor the coronavirus disease) pandemic. as the FDA (U.S. Food and DrugAdministration) approved antiviral drugs and anti-inflammatory drugs to arrestthe cytokine storm, inducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.Another view to solve these unprecedented challenges is to analyze the diversenanotechnological approaches which are able to improve the COVID-19 pandemic. In this original minireview, as promising candidates we analyze the opportunity todevelop biocompatible dendrimers as drugs themselves or as nanocarriers againstCOVID-19 disease. From the standpoint of COVID-19, we suggest developingdendrimers as shields against COVID-19 infection based on their capacity to beincorporated in several environments outside the patients and as important means to stop transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires efficient and safe antiviral treatmentstrategies. Drug repurposing represents a fast and low-cost approach to thedevelopment of new medical treatment options. The direct antiviral agentremdesivir has been reported to exert antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.Whereas remdesivir only has a very short half-life time and a bioactivation,which relies on pro-drug activating enzymes, its plasma metabolite GS-441524 can be activated through various kinases including the adenosine kinase (ADK) that ismoderately expressed in all tissues. The pharmacokinetics of GS-441524 argue for a suitable antiviral drug that can be given to patients with COVID-19. Here, weanalyzed the antiviral property of a combined treatment with the remdesivirmetabolite GS-441524 and the antidepressant fluoxetine in a polarized Calu-3 cellculture model against SARS-CoV-2. The combined treatment with GS-441524 andfluoxetine were well-tolerated and displayed synergistic antiviral effectsagainst three circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants in vitro in the commonly usedreference models for drug interaction. Thus, combinatory treatment with thevirus-targeting GS-441524 and the host-directed drug fluoxetine might offer asuitable therapeutic treatment option for SARS-CoV-2 infections.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic, starting from the latest 2019, and caused by SARS-CoV-2pathogen, led to the hardest health-socio-economic disaster in the last century. Despite the tremendous scientific efforts, mainly focused on the development ofvaccines, identification of potent and efficient anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeuticsstill represents an unmet need. Remdesivir, an anti-Ebola drug selected from arepurposing campaign, is the only drug approved, so far, for the treatment of theinfection. Nevertheless, WHO in later 2020 has recommended against its use inCOVID-19. In the present paper, we describe a step-by-step in silico design of a small library of compounds as main protease (M(pro)) inhibitors. All themolecules were screened by an enzymatic assay on M(pro) and, then, cellularactivity was evaluated using Vero cells viral infection model. The cellularscreening disclosed compounds 29 and 34 as in-vitro SARS-CoV-2 replicationinhibitors at non-toxic concentrations (0.32 < EC50 < 5.98 muM). To rationalizethese results, additional in-vitro assays were performed, focusing on papain likeprotease (PL(pro)) and spike protein (SP) as potential targets for thesynthesized molecules. This pharmacological workflow allowed the identificationof compound 29, as a dual acting SARS-CoV-2 proteases inhibitor featuringmicromolar inhibitory potency versus M(pro) (IC50 = 1.72 muM) and submicromolarpotency versus PL(pro) (IC50 = 0.67 muM), and of compound 34 as a selective SPinhibitor (IC50 = 3.26 muM).

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is a global health emergency warranting development andimplementation of targeted treatment. The enzyme main protease (M(pro); alsoknown as 3C-like protease) is emerging as an attractive drug target. This enzyme plays an indispensable role in processing the translated polyproteins of viralRNA. Inhibiting the activity of M(pro) would wedge viral replication. Tofacilitate the discovery of targeted therapy for COVID-19, we carried out thestructure-assisted repurposing of existing protease inhibiting small molecules totarget SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). Based on the structure of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro), here wereport the small drug molecule namely saquinavir as its potent inhibitor.Findings support the premise that this promising antiviral protease inhibitingsmall drug molecule can be validated and implemented for the treatment andclinical management of COVID-19 pandemic disease.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.Sarma.

AB  - Structure-based antiviral developments in the past two years have been dominated by the structure determination and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and new leadmolecules for picornaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been targetedsuccessfully with antibodies, nanobodies, and receptor protein mimics effectivelyblocking receptor binding or fusion. The two most promising non-structuralproteins sharing strong structural and functional conservation across virusfamilies are the main protease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, for whichdesign and reuse of broad range inhibitors already approved for use has been anattractive avenue. For picornaviruses, the increasing recognition of thetransient expansion of the capsid as a critical transition towards RNA releasehas been targeted through a newly identified, apparently widely conserved,druggable, interprotomer pocket preventing viral entry. We summarize some of the key papers in these areas and ponder the practical uses and contributions ofmolecular modeling alongside empirical structure determination.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has outbreak since early December 2019,and COVID-19 has caused over 100 million cases and 2 million deaths around theworld. After one year of the COVID-19 outbreak, there is no certain and approvemedicine against it. Drug repositioning has become one line of scientificresearch that is being pursued to develop an effective drug. However, due to the lack of COVID-19 data, there is still no specific drug repositioning targetingthe COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a framework for COVID-19 drugrepositioning. This framework has several advantages that can be exploited: oneis that a local graph aggregating representation is used across a heterogeneousnetwork to address the data sparsity problem; another is the multi-hop neighbors of the heterogeneous graph are aggregated to recall as many COVID-19 potentialdrugs as possible. Our experimental results show that our COVDR frameworkperforms significantly better than baseline methods, and the docking simulationverifies that our three potential drugs have the ability to against COVID-19disease.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an emerging pandemic that threatens the worldsince the early days of 2020. Development of vaccines or new drugs againstCOVID-19 comprises several stages of investigation including efficacy, safety,and approval studies. A shortcut to this delicate pathway is computational-based analysis of FDA-approved drugs against assigned molecular targets of thecoronavirus. In this study, we virtually screened a library of FDA-approved drugsprescribed for different therapeutic purposes against versatile COVID-19 specificproteins which are crucial for the virus life cycle. Three antibiotics in ourscreening polymyxin B, bafilomycin A, and rifampicin show motivating bindingstability with more than one target of the virus. Another category of testeddrugs is oral antiseptics of mouth rinsing solutions that unexpectedly exhibited significant affinity to the target proteins employed by the virus for attachment and cell internalization. Other OTC drugs widely used and tested in our study areheartburn drugs and they show no significant binding. We tested also some otherdrugs falling under the scope of investigation regarding interference with adegree of severity of COVID-19 like angiotensin II blockers used asantihypertensive, and our study suggests a therapeutic rather than predisposingeffect of these drugs against COVID-19.

TI  - Disulfiram-loaded lactoferrin nanoparticles for treating inflammatory diseases.
PG  - 1913-1920

AB  - Sepsis is a dysregulated immune response to infection and potentially leads tolife-threatening organ dysfunction, which is often seen in serious Covid-19patients. Disulfiram (DSF), an old drug that has been used to treat alcoholaddiction for decades, has recently been identified as a potent inhibitor of the gasdermin D (GSDMD)-induced pore formation that causes pyroptosis andinflammatory cytokine release. Therefore, DSF represents a promising therapeutic for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Lactoferrin (LF) is amultifunctional glycoprotein with potent antibacterial and anti-inflammatoryactivities that acts by neutralizing circulating endotoxins and activatingcellular responses. In addition, LF has been well exploited as a drug nanocarrierand targeting ligands. In this study, we developed a DSF-LF nanoparticulatesystem (DSF-LF NP) for combining the immunosuppressive activities of both DSF andLF. DSF-LF NPs could effectively block pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokinerelease from macrophages. Treatment with DSF-LF NPs showed remarkable therapeuticeffects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. In addition, this therapeuticstrategy was also applied to treat ulcerative colitis (UC), and substantialtreatment efficacy was achieved in a murine colitis model. The underlying mode ofaction of these DSF-LF-NPs may contribute to efficiently suppressingmacrophage-mediated inflammatory responses and ameliorating the complicationscaused by sepsis and UC. As macrophage pyroptosis plays a pivotal role ininflammation, this safe and effective biomimetic nanomedicine may offer aversatile therapeutic strategy for treating various inflammatory diseases byrepurposing DSF.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is raging. It revealed the importance of rapid scientificadvancement towards understanding and treating new diseases. To address thischallenge, we adapt an explainable artificial intelligence algorithm for datafusion and utilize it on new omics data on viral-host interactions, human proteininteractions, and drugs to better understand SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and predict new drug-target interactions for COVID-19. We discover that in the human interactome, the human proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the genesthat are differentially expressed after the infection have common neighborscentral in the interactome that may be key to the disease mechanisms. We uncover 185 new drug-target interactions targeting 49 of these key genes and suggestre-purposing of 149 FDA-approved drugs, including drugs targeting VEGF and nitricoxide signaling, whose pathways coincide with the observed COVID-19 symptoms. Ourintegrative methodology is universal and can enable insight into this and otherserious diseases.
